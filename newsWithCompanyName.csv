About two shares declined for every share rising on the NSE.""Widening fiscal deficit and rising crude oil prices concerns continued to hurt sentiment. Investors turned cautious ahead of major events in the month ahead - RBI policy, FOMC meet and Gujarat assembly elections. The current price action on the weekly as well as on the daily chart suggests that the demand zone of 10171 to 10094 holds significance going forward,"" Arpit Jain, AVP at Arihant Capital Markets said in a statement.Going forward, developments such as two new IPOs, RBI policy, oil prices apart from corporate-specific developments will dominate the Street.IPOThe Street will witness two more companies hitting the primary market for raising funds—Shalby Hospital and Future Supply Chain.Ahmedabad-based multi-speciality hospital chain Shalby’s IPO will be opening on December 5, 2017. It has fixed the price band between Rs 245 to Rs 248 per equity share for its proposed initial public offer (IPO) to raise about Rs 504 crore. The offer comprises a fresh issue of equity shares aggregating up to Rs 480 crore and an offer for sale of up to 10,00,000 equity shares by the selling shareholder.Proceeds of the IPO will be utilised towards repayment of borrowings availed by the company besides purchasing medical equipment for existing, recently set-up as well as upcoming hospitals, the company said. The offer will open on December 5 and closes on December 7.Meanwhile, Future Supply Chain Solutions said that the promoters and PE investor Griffin will together sell 24.43 percent to raise up to Rs 650 crore through the initial public offer that hits the market on December 6.The company has fixed a price band of Rs 655-660 for the issue which will offer up to 9,784,570 equity shares that has a face value of Rs 10 each, and an offer-for-sale of up to 7,827,656 shares or 20 percent equity by Griffin Partners.RBI policyInvestors will look forward to cues from the central bank next week. The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will be meeting on December 5 and 6, the outcome of which will be crucial for the Street.During its last meet, the MPC kept benchmark repo and reverse repo rates unchanged at 6 percent and 5.75 percent, respectively.According to a Reuters report, impatient for faster economic growth, India’s government is lobbying for a reduction in official interest rates in coming months as it expects inflation to stay close to a 4 percent target, finance ministry officials said.The finance ministry, according to officials, wants a rate cut sooner than that, putting a focus on the MPC meeting on Dec. 5-6, or when it next convenes in February.“We expect the RBI to cut policy rates, if not in December then in its next policy review,” one ministry official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. After that, he said, higher oil prices could fuel inflation, making it more difficult to cut rates.Infosys in focusIT bellwether Infosys will be on the radar of investors next week after the wait for a new CEO ended on Saturday. The company, in a filing to exchanges, announced Salil Parekh as the CEO and MD, effective January 2, 2018.“We are delighted to have Salil joining as the CEO & MD of Infosys. He has nearly three decades of global experience in the IT services industry. He has a strong track record of executing business turnarounds and managing very successful acquisitions. The Board believes that he is the right person to lead Infosys at this transformative time in our industry. The Board is also grateful to Pravin for his leadership during this period of transition,” Nandan Nilekani, Chairman of the Board, said in the statement filed to the exchanges.UB Pravin Rao will step down as the interim CEO and Managing Director effective January 2, 2018 and will continue as Chief Operating Officer and a whole-time Director of the Company.Stocks in focusFew stocks could be in focus based on corporate developments over the weekend. A report from Cogencis said Fitch could downgrade JSW Steel’s rating in 2018 due to high leverage.Among other stocks in focus could be Wipro after reports stated National Grid US has filed a lawsuit against the company in a US court and has sought USD 140 million in damages. The company has refuted National Grid’s claims and said it will \'vigorously’ contest allegations in court.Couple of banks such as Dena Bank and Central Bank of India could be in focus after the former cut MCLR rate by 5-15 basis points in some tenors, while the latter cut it by 5-20 basis points in most tenors.DLF will be in focus after the Board gave an approval for raising funds of around Rs 3,500 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP). With this, the company’s debt is likely to be reduced by Rs 14,000 crore.Macro DataAmong key macro data could be Nikkei services PMI that will be out on December 5. This is apart from the RBI\'s MPC meet outcome that will be out next week as well. On a global front, Europe will be declaring its PMI data, along with the US.Crude oil imports will also be released by the US on December 6, a key metric for oil prices to move. European and Japanese GDP data will be out later during the week. The US will also be releasing data related to employment in the country. The Street could take note of all these numbers going forward.Pharma actionsPharmaceutical stocks have been very active this year, considering the volatility due to US price erosion, regulatory issues and domestic regulations as well. But actions in a few stocks could prep up the pharma sector atleast to the start of the week.For instance,Biocon Mylan’s biosimilar to Roche’s Herceptinhas received an approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. Herceptin is a drug used to treat breast cancer.Meanwhile, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories could also see some spike up after the company received establishment inspection report (EIR) for Miyapur facility in Hyderabad. The company had received zero observations from US FDA for Miyapur unit in September.Corporate ActionApart from 200-odd small and medium BSE companies that will be declaring their results in the upcoming week, few companies would be in focus on expectation of\xa0a\xa0dividend announcement, and AGMs.Companies such as Siyaram Silks, Monsanto, 20 Microns and MM Forgings, among others, will be having their Board meetings to discuss their dividend issue.Meanwhile, NBI Industrial Finance and Lakshmi Vilas Bank could be in focus on the back of a stock split and rights issue.Global CuesAny geopolitical tensions arising out of North Korea could keep the market on its feet. Last week, the rogue nation was believed to have tested a missile that could hit the US continent completely.Developments on those fronts could affect the Street here. According to a report on cnbc.com, there are signs that North Korea\'s submarine missile program is expanding as it prepares its second test, adding to the risk that the nuclear-armed country could one day threaten the US or its Asian allies with yet another powerful weapon in its arsenal.Experts suggest North Korea having fully submersible submarines firing a nuclear ballistic missile pose a dangerous scenario because they could offer the hermit regime a better chance of survival and might be harder to detect. It comes on the heels of North Korea on Tuesday launching a new Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile, a road-mobile weapon the state-owned KCNA media claimed could carry a ""super-large heavy warhead, which is capable of striking the whole mainland of the U.S.""The Street will also watch out for US markets’ reactions to the tax legislation passed by the Senate on Saturday.Senate Republicans narrowly passed a bill to overhaul the American tax system in the wee hours of Saturday morning, navigating party fractures to approve a plan that lawmakers were still scraping together in the hours before the vote.With the 51-49 vote, the GOP leaps closer to its promise of dramatically remaking U.S. tax law under a Republican-led government. Republicans see changing the tax code as crucial to their electoral success after GOP opposition sank attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Following the vote, Trump tweeted that Republicans were ""one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts"" and said he wanted to sign a bill by Christmas.Oil pricesThe Street will keep a close watch on oil prices, which have been surging in the recent past. A spike in these prices could impact India’s finances as well.Oil prices spiked higher on Friday, heading toward 2½-year highs the morning after two dozen crude-producing nations agreed to limit their output through the end of 2018.US West Texas Intermediate crude prices rocketed up 98 cents per barrel, or 1.7 percent, to $58.38 by 11:15 a.m. ET. That put the contract within striking distance of $59.05, its peak for this year and the highest level since July 2015.International benchmark Brent crude surged $1.11, or 1.8 percent, to $63.74, not far off last month\'s high of $64.65 that marked the best intraday level since June 2015. ""Prices have been supported in the aftermath of the OPEC meeting,"" said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital told CNBC.Technical FactorsThe Nifty failed to hold above 10,200 as selling pressure continued for the second consecutive day in a row at higher levels on Friday. The index made a bearish candle for the fourth consecutive day in a row.The Nifty slipped below its crucial support placed at 50-days exponential moving average (DEMA) and now a break below 10,100 could fuel further selling pressure which could take the index towards 10,000.“The underlying near term trend of Nifty is sharply down and one may expect some more weakness during early to mid-part of next week,” HDFC Securities said in its report.The presence of strong supports and the overall chart pattern is indicating a possibility of Nifty showing further decline down to 10050-10000 levels initially and then the possibility of emergence of value buying from the lows.']"

The S&P BSE Sensex which climbed Mount 33K is now trading around 32,700 levels.Benchmark indices climbed to record highs in the month of November but since then the trend shifted downwards.It looks like market participants prefer to be on the sidelines ahead of key events such as US Federal Reserve policy meet and back home, the outcome of state election results. However, analysts advise investors to buy stocks on dips whenever possible as the structural bull market is still intact.Nilesh Shah, MD, and CEO of Envision Capital sees a shallow correction for the Street. “It looks like there could be 4-5 percent correction ahead. That is how markets have behaved and it is unlikely to move in some other way. This could be year-end profit booking,” Shah told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.Will political outcomes from state and general elections ahead make any impact on the market ahead? Shah said he won’t be surprised if political debate takes over the market between 2018 and 2019.Frontline indices are going through a corrective phase, with the Nifty shedding around 300-350 odd points from record highs.While some investors could raise concerns over it, but market veterans such as Madhusudan Kela see this time as a positive thing.“There are plenty opportunities which are there in the markets, both in midcaps and large-caps. Corrections like these give investors to capture the opportunity,”Kela told CNBC-TV18 in an interview.Further, he said that such a correction was long overdue as there has not been one since Nifty’s levels of around 7,800.Speaking on the impact of upcoming Gujarat elections, Kela believes that if the verdict goes, either way, a meaningful correction is unlikely.']"

It is also the fastest growing HFC with a strong loan book CAGR of 38% over FY12-17.Indian economy would require an investment of around USD1.0tn over the next five to seven years to meet the increasing infrastructure and housing demand at the current growth levels.CFHL has a strong marketing and distribution network of 170 outlets spread across 19 states and is well placed to exploit the huge growth opportunities.We believe that the renewed vigour to expand balance sheet and new branch additions in recent months will help the company to sustain a loan book growth of 25 percent CAGR over FY17-19E.Tata Motors:Tata motors (TAMO) is India’s largest CV manufacturer is aiming to increases its current market share from 55% to 60% in 2 to 3 years on the back of six new launches and four new launches in ILCV segment in FY18.PV standalone sales growth for H1FY18 was 12 percent YoY led by the success of recent launches including Tiago, Tigor and Nexon and the trend to continue for a full year.We project overall revenue & PAT growth of 13 percent and 33 percent CAGR over FY17-19E, driven by 10 percent growth in JLR volume and successful launches in the standalone business.We value the stock on SOTP basis, ascribing separate value to JLR (3.5xEV/EBITDA), China JV (3.5x EV/EBITDA), standalone (8x EV/EBITDA) & investment in subsidiaries (using P/E, P/BV), recommend Buy rating with a target of Rs508.NBCC:Mammoth order book of Rs75,000cr (12x FY17 sales) provides strong visibility for next 5yrs. NBCC is at the sweet spot with an inflow guidance of Rs25,000cr for FY18E, limited competition, and expertise in executing large projects.Execution from large redevelopment is likely to improve from H2FY18E which will add impetus for re-rating. With pick up in execution, we factored earnings to grow at 42 percent CAGR over FY17-19E supported by 60bps improvement in EBITDA margin.Considering the asset-light PMC segment, less leveraged balance sheet and robust opportunities in the pipeline, NBCC will command premium valuation in the construction space.Bharat ElectronicsLtd:Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) has 37 percent market share in defence electronics and its core capabilities are in radar & weapons systems, defence communication & electronic warfare.BEL has limited competition, due to its niche capabilities and strong technological tie-ups, strategic nature of projects, capital-intensive nature & high gestation periods act as strong barriers to competition.Going forward, BEL will emerge as a key beneficiary from on-going defence modernization programmes & GoI focus on indigenisation. The current order backlog of Rs41,052cr is 5x FY17 sales, which has significantly improved the earnings outlook.Aarti IndustriesLtd:AARTI Industries Ltd (ARTO) is a global leader in Benzene based derivative products.

Major banks, and index heavyweightsInfosysandITCwill announce earnings during the week.According to experts, if banks disappoint the Street with weak quarterly earnings particularly indicating continued asset quality concerns then there could be further fall in the market. Most experts, however, do firmly believe the asset quality woes will\xa0ease during the next financial year.

For the coming expiry week, this trend is expected to continue, ICICIdirect feels. Declines in the Nifty should be taken as a buying opportunity, he advised.Here are 10 things that will keep investors busy next week:-EarningsSeptember quarter earnings season started off on a positive note but Axis Bank earnings - the major one - announced before Diwali was disappointing and hit market sentiment.The flow of results announcement was bit slow due to Diwali holiday in the week gone by but in the coming week, about 182 companies (as per BSE data) will release their earnings for the quarter ended September 2017. Major ones among them would be Infosys, HDFC Bank, Yes Bank, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, IOC, ITC, HCL Technologies, ONGC, HUL, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Asian Paints, Ambuja Cements, ABB India, Zee Entertainment, L&T Finance, M&M Financial, Mindtree, RBL Bank, Biocon, Jubilant Foodworks, Canara Bank, Adani Transmission and Bharat Financial.InfosysInfosys, which normally kicks off the earnings season, postponed its results announcement date. It will deliver results for July-September quarter on October 24, around 15:45 hours IST.The key thing to watch out for would be commentary from new interim CEO UB Pravin Rao and Co-founder Nandan Nikekani who was appointed as Non-Executive Chairman of the company on August 24, after Vishal Sikka resigned as CEO and MD.""Key issues to watch out for would be an update on internal stability of the company; commentary around contribution of newly launched services, and revenue scale and growth from products and solutions; and commentary around macro, verticals, margins and pricing,"" Motilal Oswal said.Motilal Oswal expects Infosys to report 2 percent growth in constant currency revenue in Q2 QoQ while ICICIdirect sees constant currency revenue growth at 2.5 percent QoQ against 2.7 percent in Q1.The country\'s second largest software company had been in focus due to the fight between the board members and Co-founder Narayana Murthy over corporate governance standards.BanksBanks earnings will be in focus, especially after Axis Bank, the country\'s third largest private sector lender, recorded a sharp rise in slippages that increased its non-performing assets sharply. Nifty Bank fell nearly 700 points in three consecutive sessions.Asset quality will be key to watch for. Profit of majority of banks may be higher due to a low base in the year-ago quarter that was hit by higher provisions.ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Yes Bank, Canara Bank, IDFC Bank, RBL Bank and Vijaya Bank will announce their July-September quarter earnings in the coming week.Most experts, before Q2 earnings, expect the asset quality to improve from the fourth quarter (FY18) onwards. Hence, the key thing to watch for would be their earnings estimates for FY19.F&O ExpiryFutures and options contracts for October series on the National Stock Exchange will expire on Thursday in the coming week and traders will roll over their positions in November series.Maximum call open interest (OI) of 46.7 lakh contracts stands at strike price 10,200, which will act as a crucial resistance level for the index in the October series, followed by 10,300, which now holds 38.71 lakh contracts in open interest.Maximum Put OI of 75.18 lakh contracts was seen at strike price 10,000, which will act as a crucial base for the index in October series, followed by 10,100, which now holds 45.59 lakh contracts.Technical OutlookAfter its recent record high followed by a sharp fall, technical experts expect the market to consolidate in the range of 10,000-10,200 in the coming week. On the medium-to-long term perspective, they see Nifty crossing 10,500 level.“Going forward, we expect the index to remain on a rising trajectory and extend the up-move towards 10,600 in coming months. The measuring implication of the bullish Double Bottom pattern (10,170 to 9,700 = 470 points) added to the breakout point of 10,170 projects upsides toward 10,600 regions over the coming months,” Dharmesh Shah – Head Technical, ICICI Direct.com Research said.Atul Suri, Chief Investment Officer at Marathon Trends PMS, sees near-term pain for the market if Nifty Bank underperforms which could lead to some consolidation in the market.

The Nifty has already hit a high and the Sensex followed suit. So far as Samvat 2074 is concerned, I am optimistic about the market.related newsMarket snaps 6-day gaining streak: Experts discuss the outlook & specific stocksGautam Shah feels market still far from major top, could gain 10-12% in 2018Remain stock specific ahead of Budget 2018; 3 stocks which could give up to 20% returnI am expecting Nifty to give 15-17 percent returns in the next one year. The main reason for this surge is healthy domestic inflows and I don’t see any reason why domestic inflows would reduce in coming months.Insight 18 | Samvat 2074: The Story Behind Muhurat TradingMutual funds have seen a huge demand with retail investors pumping money into the system. Besides, foreign flows would also continue to chase India considering its size and high growth compared to the rest of the emerging markets.I see market continuing this momentum and scaling new heights next year.Any top stocks which you think are under-owned but have tremendous potential to deliver strong returns in next 3-5 years?As per our house view some stocks suggested are --Century Plyboards,Tata Motors DVR,ICICI Prudential Life Insurance,Ujjivan Financial ServicesandCG Power.It looks like the market has climbed wall of worries – earnings growth, muted macros and geopolitical concerns. What is your target for Nifty and Sensex for FY18?I agree that markets have crossed all walls of worries even as we say prices are slaves of earnings and there have been some muted earnings in the last financial year. But I expect the next year to be much better in corporate earnings than this year.I am sure the effect of demonetisation on the economy will fade out over the next year and even the positive aspects of GST will be clearly visible clearly in the earnings.Overall, the market looks good for 2018 and I expect Nifty and Sensex to deliver around 15 to 17 percent growth in the coming year.IPO mania has gripped D-Street with most primary offers getting oversubscribed multiple times. Do you see the trend continuing for Samvat 2074? What is the kind of money we are talking about?We have seen a huge surge in IPOs in the last 12 months there has been active participation from retail investors in all the good quality IPOs.I am confident that the same mania will continue for the next 12months as well. However, it also depends on the quality of the IPOs’, as we have seen good quality IPOs last year like D-mart, ICIC Lombard etc. hitting the market.If we get good quality companies coming into the stock market and we have a fair valuation, investors would grab such opportunities and see oversubscriptions in these IPOs.It will be difficult to put numbers on IPOs but with IPOs like NSE, SBI Life Insurance, Reliance AMC and others, the quality IPO pipeline looks good. The amount to be raised, I believe, would be almost equal to last year or may be higher.What is your call on the broader market? The euphoria doesn’t seem to die down. Should investors\xa0keep accumulating or book profits?Though markets look a bit stretched on the EPS front, the price to book still looks attractive. It is a phase of caution and one should focus on quality only.Investors will get an opportunity to invest in specific stocks, so my advice to the investors will be look for good quality companies either in midcap small cap or large cap in invest for a long term.The way domestic money is flowing into equity markets – do you think it is a cause of worry? Equities are high return but at the same time high-risk instruments. There is always a possibility of a negative return – will that dent optimism?In the last one year, there is a huge inflow in the equity market. If you see September itself, we got a record of Rs 5,000 crore coming only into SIP\xa0in the equity market.Even though I agree equity has a high return, it also has a high risk as well involved but the money coming as SIP is normally for a long-term and the kind of SIP amount month on month we are seeing has shown 46 percent growth as compared to last year.It clearly means that the money is coming for long-term and if the money is coming for long-term then the flow will continue and I don’t think there is any reason to worry.The only reason why it would reduce will be purely dependent on earnings of companies. Otherwise, I don’t see any problem in the domestic inflow of money because it is healthy and good money is coming from equity in the form of SIP.What is the one thing or habit you want investors to start this Diwali with respect to trading or portfolio?Investing in the stock market should be a long-term strategy. If any retail investor is looking to approach the stock market it should be through mutual fund SIP in the beginning.The objective should be for long term and if they make a habit of regularly investing into market then it is statistically proofed over time and you negate the cyclical behaviour of market and you negate the rise and drops in the prices which may affect your portfolio or stocks.One thing all investors should start from this Diwali is to invest one fixed amount in a month and make it a habit of investing rather than making it a one-time activity. Only if you have access to good research and advisory do invest directly, else SIP is the best.Some analysts expect earnings to recover slightly in the September quarter. What are your views?We expect some recovery in the September quarter, but significant recovery is likely in the quarters after and the next financial year.Which sectors are likely to lead the next leg of the rally?Our house research is overweight on NBFC, infrastructure, and metals.']"

If you would have invested in equities at the start of Samvat 2073 chances are you might be sitting on a huge pile of profits.However, chances of you making a sound return on your investments increase exponentially if you would have invested in ten stocks which historically have given smart double-digit returns in the last five Samvat years.Top stocks which have given returns up to 300 percent in the last four out of five Samvat years include names like Britannia Industries, Eicher Motors, Transpek Industry, Avanti Feeds, Hester Bio, Natco Pharma, Hatsun Agro, Sakuma Exports, LT Foods, Ruchira Papers and Indian Terrain.related newsTechnical View: Nifty forms ‘Hanging Man’ pattern; 11,110 crucial for bullsBudget 2018: Housing, infrastructure, and rural economy theme may remain in focusNo high beta but quality to lead rally in 2018; 10 stocks which can give up to 37% returnBritannia Industries, the FMCG major, more than doubled investors’ wealth in two out of five Samvat years.

The stock hit a fresh record high on Tuesday. It has already rallied over 400 percent so far in the year 2017 and about 360 percent in Samvat 2073.It rose by about 3 percent in Samvat 2072 but it has been a massive outperformer in the last five years. The stock rose over 500 percent in Samvat 2017 and over 50 percent each in Samvat 2071 and Samvat 2069.Ruchira Papers, LT Foods, Sakuma Exports, Hatsun Agro also did not disappoint investors. Shares of these companies more than doubled investors’ wealth in two out of five Samvat years.Sectoral PerformanceAmong the sectors, the S&P BSE Consumer Durable index rose by over 40 percent in Samvat 2073, followed by metals index which rose 39 percent, and Realty index gained 37 percent in the same period.The S&P BSE Smallcap index rose 24 percent while the S&P BSE Midcap index gained 18 percent compared to 16 percent rise in the S&P BSE Sensex.Going into Samvat 2074, analysts advise investors to focus on sectors which are related to consumption, economy and govt policy.These sectors are likely to hog the limelight. IT and pharma could well show some gains if the rupee depreciates further but they have headwinds which would cap upside.“The key overweight sectors for us are – Cement, Capital Goods, and Oil & Gas. Government’s continued focus on affordable housing and infrastructure creation should aid demand in Cement and Capital Goods,” Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO- Equity, Kotak Mutual Fund told Moneycontrol.Oil&Gas sector is likely to deliver one of the more consistent sets of earnings growth in the market and is also reasonably valued.“Some other sectors such as Pharma, Telecom and IT are facing structural headwinds and earnings are under pressure. We do not envisage any improvement in the short to medium term in these sectors,” said Upadhyaya.He further added that valuation-wise there are many other sectors such as NBFCs, FMCG etc. which are trading at rich multiples, and therefore could pose risk.Outlook for Samvat 2074Samvat 2074 is unlikely to be any different from Samvat 2073. Analysts expect stock specific action to dominate next 12 months while benchmark indices could well give another high teen return in the same period.The broader market looks extremely strong although some stocks could be displaying frothy valuations. But, corporate earnings growth which is likely to rebound in next few quarters should lead the recovery and support sentiments, suggest experts.“Market looks extremely strong and amid a bull rally.

']","['Picking stocks to invest in could be tricky at times, particularly when there are tips flying around left, right and centre. There are many aspects one must ideally consider before settling on a scrip to invest in because rushing in blindly to where the light is shining the brightest may not always pay off.A DuPont analysis is one of the most apt indicators to go by when it comes to picking stocks because it gives you the exact return on equity (RoE) for a particular stock. In order to do so, it combines three of the most important parameters that pertain to the profitability of a company -- operating profit margin, operational efficiency (based on total asset turnover), and financial leverage (based on ratio of total assets to equity).However, a DuPont analysis is only a tool of measure and does not exactly spell out which stock is worth investing in. In order to do so, Moneycontrol did a DuPont analysis of its own to pick out stocks that checked all our parameters -- an increasing operating profit margin, an increasing asset turnover, and a decreasing asset-to-equity ratio.An increasing operating profit margin indicates that a company is making more today for the same amount of products sold than it was making earlier, while an increasing asset turnover is indicative of improving profitability of a company as a whole. A decreasing asset-to-equity ratio indicates that a company is less dependent on debt than it was before.related newsTechnical View: Nifty forms ‘Hanging Man’ pattern; 11,110 crucial for bullsBudget 2018: Housing, infrastructure, and rural economy theme may remain in focusNo high beta but quality to lead rally in 2018; 10 stocks which can give up to 37% returnAlthough there are many companies who reported an increase in their return on equity over the last three years, only 15 managed to do so while meeting all three above-mentioned criteria.

But, for the index to hit fresh record highs of 10600-10650, Nifty has to hold above 10500 on a closing basis.HDFC Securities believes that underlying trend of Nifty from daily to monthly time frame is intact and bulls are still placed at the front seat. There is no confirmation of any reversal signals yet.“The careful study of larger timeframe (weekly and monthly) is revealing that the market is gradually showing some signs of significant maturity at the new highs. Momentum and trend strength oscillators of weekly/monthly timeframes are indicating cautious approach at the highs,” the brokerage house said in a statement.FII FlowsDomestic investors continued to be net buyers for December, offering support to the market at a time when FIIs have looked hesitant in this market too. Experts believe that it is this buying by DIIs that has provided the cushion to D-Street. For December, FIIs sold Rs 6,411.57 crore worth of shares, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net buyers worth Rs 8,142.88 crore.Global CuesThe Street will watch out for crucial economic data coming in from developed and other emerging markets. For instance, China, Europe and US will be declaring their manufacturing PMI on January 2, followed by truck sales and services PMI in US and China later in the week. Further, market could take cues from European CPI inflation, along with US employment data.CrudeThe Street will watch out for cues on the movement of crude oil. As such, markets have been rattled in the recent past on the back of rising oil prices. Brent crude prices have clocked USD 65-mark and have hovering around the same region. Meanwhile, US crude is also seen rising and settled around USD 60-mark.Experts that Moneycontrol spoke to believe that so long that the commodity does not touch around USD 70, it may not be a threat. But a move above that could mean all bets being off.Bond MovementBond yields have been rising in the recent past, largely on the back of inflationary issues as well as rising crude prices. This has, in turn, affected the markets here and got investors cautious of the movements as well.Last week, the yields had also jumped after the government announced additional borrowing of around Rs 50,000 crore through gilts. The RBI has also swung into action as it cancelled two bond auctions on Friday. Yields were seen stabilizing after that move.Going forward, experts believe, there could be further hardening on likely reversing of easing cycle by the RBI amid inflationary risks. Government borrowing has also worried investors.BitcoinThe Street would also look to see the regulatory view on bitcoins, the virtual currency which has witnessed phenomenal gains in the recent past. The currency clocked USD 19,000 during the year, before seeing a sell off, but has settled down from its wild swings.The Ministry of Finance has cautioned people against investing in virtual currencies and compared them to ponzi schemes.""There has been a phenomenal increase in recent times in the price of Virtual \'Currencies\' (VCs) including bitcoin, in India and globally. The VCs don\'t have any intrinsic value and are not backed by any kind of assets. The price of bitcoin and other VCs, therefore, is entirely a matter of mere speculation resulting in spurt and volatility in their price.""Moreover, the Ministry of Finance has cautioned people against investing in virtual currencies and compared them to ponzi schemes.""There has been a phenomenal increase in recent times in the price of Virtual \'Currencies\' (VCs) including bitcoin, in India and globally.

Although the rise of equity as an asset class is something which the whole world has witnessed.It has been a year where the S&P BSE Sensex hit Mount 33K while the Nifty50 rose above 10,000 but there is more to come, suggest experts. The rally which started in December 2016 is unlikely to lose steam anytime soon. The index made a fresh record high of 33,733.71 on Sensex last week while Nifty rose to a record high of 10,461.One of the major factors contributing to the rise in Indian markets is strong rally seen in global markets and pro-growth reforms initiated by the Modi-government in the past 12 months.Initiation of reforms supported a rise in small and midcap stocks, some of which are already trading above historical averages.

Our view is to stick with high-quality stocks and sectors within the mid-caps as they are likely to continue its outperformance in the long-term,” he said.Domestic money has been one of the driving factors in driving rally in the small and midcap space but analysts’ are of the view that the risk to midcaps is a change in the global liquidity, which will impact the overall performance of the broad market risking mid-caps to underperform.We have collated a list of top ten stocks across analysts from different brokerage firms which investors can look at for a holding period of more than 12 months:Analyst: Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial ServicesNBCCMammoth order book of Rs75,000cr (12x FY17 sales) provides strong visibility for next 5yrs. NBCC is at the sweet spot with an inflow guidance of Rs25,000cr for FY18E, limited competition, and expertise in executing large projects.Execution from large redevelopment is likely to improve from H2FY18E which will add impetus for re-rating. With pick up in execution, we factored earnings to grow at 42 percent CAGR over FY17-19E supported by 60bps improvement in EBITDA margin.Considering the asset-light PMC segment, less leveraged balance sheet and robust opportunities in the pipeline, NBCC will command premium valuation in the construction space.Bharat ElectronicsBharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) has 37 percent market share in defence electronics and its core capabilities are in radar & weapons systems, defence communication & electronic warfare.BEL has limited competition, due to its niche capabilities and strong technological tie-ups, strategic nature of projects, capital-intensive nature & high gestation periods act as strong barriers to competition.Going forward, BEL will emerge as a key beneficiary from on-going defense modernization programmes & GoI focus on indigenisation. The current order backlog of Rs41,052cr is 5x FY17 sales, which has significantly improved the earnings outlook.Aarti IndustriesAARTI Industries Ltd (ARTO) is a global leader in Benzene based derivative products. Has a diversified product portfolio with end users in pharma, agrochemicals, specialty polymers, paints & pigments.Exceptional performance over FY11-FY17, Revenue and PAT grew by14 percent & 25 percent CAGR, respectively. Focus on high margin products and cost reduction through forward and backward integration led to expansion in EBITDA margins to 20.7 percent from 13.6 percent during FY11- FY17.During last 2-3yrs, ARTO is aggressively building CAPEX in various product categories with a focus on global markets.Currently, global chemical companies are de-risking the supply chain for their raw material by diversifying from China to India, which will benefit domestic companies like ARTO.Global Brokerage FirmsHULDeutsche Bank maintains a buy rating on HUL despite outperformance of the stock with respect to benchmark index so far in the year 2017.It is not easy to be unhappy when your top Staples pick reports a 20 percent EBITDA growth (better than expected) and the outlook for price growth is improving.However, the 4 percent volume growth is worrisome as it indicates an underlying deceleration in consumption. While the (perennial) hope of a rural consumption recovery exists for CY2018, at 45X FY19E P/E, the margin of safety is low.The key takeaway from the conference call was “modest improvement in margins defined as a minimum of c80 bps expansion” (our interpretation). The brokerage firm maintains a Buy despite CYTD2017 stock returns of 54 percent (Sensex +24 percent).Yes BankDeutsche Bank maintains a buy rating on Yes Bank even though the private sector lender reported a significant divergence on its asset quality Rs64bn, (~5 percent of FY17 loans).Even though repayments or upgrades are high at Rs47bn, divergences are still discomforting. Yet, historical evidence of actual losses is low, probably due to bilateral dealings and better collaterals.For FY15/FY16, it had a divergence of 3 percent/3.2 percent of loans, but actual NPLs were only 15-20 percent and credit costs were contained at 50-60 percent (due to better recoveries); management guides for similar trends in FY17.The global investment bank raised their slippage and credit cost estimates (from 75 bps to 90 bps for FY18/19). The earnings impact is limited to 3-4 percent, as core business trends are stronger than estimated.Bharat ForgeDeutsche Bank recently upgraded Bharat Forge on the basis of an improving revenue growth trajectory. This was premised on the combination of strong data points and customer commentary, which pointed towards a sustained recovery in its end-markets.The flow of data and commentary since then has continued to be upbeat and strengthens our positive view on the stock. We highlight below the specific trends that we follow to form our view on the stock.The information has been collated from industry data points and management commentary, as well as research published by our global colleagues.Mahindra & Mahindra Financial ServicesThe asset quality is stabilising and MMFS a good rural play. The global investment bank expects ROEs to recover to 16 percent by FY20F from 6-11 percent in the past two years, as the rural credit cycle normalizes and growth of (loans) picks up to a 17 percent CAGR over FY17-20F, compared to 11 percent over FY14-17.The global investment bank increased its target price to Rs475 per share, implying 2.4x Sep-19 book.EmamiNomura maintains a buy rating on Emami post Q2 results. Emami’s 2QFY18 results were in line with our expectations on all counts. The growth trajectory has recovered significantly and the outlook remains more positive.Further, the company has started the process of sales force automation and is working on reducing its dependence on the wholesale trade channel, which should yield positive results in the medium term.After a long gap, the company has reinstated its focus on innovation, which the global investment bank saw as a positive. Nomura continues to like the long-term story, believe the risk-reward is inexpensive and maintain a Buy rating.Nomura now builds in a revenue growth of 10.3 percent and a modest 10bps y-y margin contraction in FY18F.Maruti SuzukiMacquarie maintains an outperform rating on Maruti Suzuki post Q2 results and raised its target price to Rs10,000 from Rs8250 earlier.Maruti is the best play on the Indian auto growth. The global investment bank expects Maruti to grow ahead of the industry given new model launches and extensive dealership network.It expects the net profit for Maruti Suzuki to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 17 percent over March 2020.Mahindra CIE AutomotiveMacquarie maintains a buy rating on Mahindra CIE (MACA). The company reported better-than-expected results for 3QCY17 with consolidated EBITDA growing 55 percent on a YoY basis (3 percent ahead of our expectations).The key drivers of strong profit growth in 3QCY17 were i) the consolidation of Bill Forge business, ii) growth in automobile and tractor production in India, iii) new customer orders in India and Europe and iv) margin improvement on the back of increased cost efficiencies.Disclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

What is your target for Nifty and Sensex for FY18?Our current Sensex target for March FY18 is 31,000 which was reduced last quarter by 5 percent due to a poor start to financial year result.Any update to the target will depend on the performance of Q2 result which is looking promising compared to earlier expectations.The IPO mania has gripped D-Street with most primary offers getting oversubscribed multiple times? Do you see the trend continuing for Samvat 2074? What is the kind of money we are talking about?This trend is likely to be maintained as the market is breaking its own high, premium valuation of the secondary market which may be attracting investors towards IPOs and as many companies are waiting for a nod from SEBI due to attractive pricing.This trend cannot be shattered unless the market falls by more than 10 percent disturbing the confidence of retail investors who are currently shifting their liquidity towards primary, secondary and MF.This is owing to a change in investment style of public from physical to financial assets due to investor awareness and structural reform undertaken by the government towards cash hoarding.Small and midcap index fresh record highs. What is your call on the broader market? The euphoria doesn’t seem to die down? What should investors do — keep accumulating or book profits?Currently, we have a cautious view on the broad market due to high valuation, slow growth in earnings than required and change in global liquidity due to the appreciation of USD.At the same time, we are constructively positive on India since the premium valuation of the country is likely to be maintained over the long-term as country risk are reducing.We are also positive on specific sectors and stocks gave improvement in business outlook and enhanced profitability for organised players over the next 1-2 years which is very attractive for equity as an investment class.Our idea to retail investors is to be stock & sector specific to outperform the market.Some analysts expect earnings to recover slightly in the September quarter. What are your views?We too agree with the view. In Q1, earnings growth for Sensex was negative at -6.5 percent on a YoY basis, the worst is over. Now, for Q2, the expectation is over 6 percent on a YoY basis and will expand further by the end of H2FY18.

Where do you see markets headed in the next 6 months of FY18?We had cut our target for Sensex by 5 percent last quarter to 31,000, post poor Q1FY18 results. This was due to lower results than expectation and premium valuation which was increasing despite lack of earnings growth.We continue to have a cautions view in the near-term due to a slowdown in economic activities and liquidity from FIIs and non-MF institutions.Vinod NairHead of Research|Geojit Financial ServicesRural, infra to hog limelight in Budget 2018 — 5 stocks that could turn multibaggersBudget related cues as well as Infosys, TCS Q3 results to steer market direction this weekConsider adding quality stocks available for 10-20% lower than a month ago: GeojitAt the same time, we also feel that the trend of this consolidation will be limited since earnings are likely to come back over the next 1-2 quarters as economic activities resume post the stabilisation of GST procedures.Slipping macros is something which is troubling market participants at the current juncture. Do you think this will cap the upside for Indian markets or are such fears unfounded?It is already impacting the performance of the market in the last 2-3 months and we feel that it could continue in the near-term due to the risk of a further downgrade in earnings.At the same time, another factor which will increase the impact is a change in global liquidity. Though QE is likely to be reduced over the long-term it may have a conflict in the near-term due to a change in global investors’ perception.What is your call on the rupee? Do you see it heading towards Rs 70/USD in the near-term?Recently, the rupee had started to depreciate due to selling in India by FIIs within the EM basket. We feel it was largely in anticipation of breaching the fiscal deficit, a slowdown in economy growth and premium valuations compared to other EMs.Currently, the rupee is under relief as FIIsd selling has stabilized, but this trend can continue as per the outcome of Q2 results and pace of reducing in QE by US Fed & ECB.September quarter earnings will kick off from next month. Do you expect a recovery in earnings in this quarter?We expect Q2 to be better than Q1 as mentioned by the uptick in WPI and IIP numbers. This will give a relief to the market as the trend is likely to improve on a QoQ basis.But, on a YoY basis, the economy stance is likely to be subdued hence downgrade in earnings may continue depending on the sector-wise performance.What is pushing foreign investors away from Indian markets? They sold about Rs 11000 crore from Indian equity markets in September.It is largely due to India's premium valuation within the EM basket. This premium is expanding as earnings growth is reducing due to the double whammy of demonetisation and GST.For example, Sensex's PAT growth in Q1FY18 was -6 percent. As a result, the confidence of the market is also coming down. We feel earning growth will resume over the next 2 quarters but by that time what will be the view of FIIs on the EM will depend on the change in\xa0Quantitative Easing policy.The US Fed is planning to reduce QE over the long-term in a structured manner.Your list of top five stocks which could turn multibaggers in the next 2-3 years?Here is a list of top 5 stocks which could give superior returns:Bharat ElectronicsBEL will emerge as a key beneficiary from the on-going defence modernisation programmes & GoI focus on indigenisation.

We value BEL at P/E of 22x on FY19E on improved order inflow outlook.SymphonySymphony is the largest air cooler manufacturer with a market share of ~50 percent in the organised market in India.

Consolidated Revenue/PAT to grow at 14 percent/57 percent\xa0CAGR over CY16-18E led by increase in order book from OEMs & recent\xa0acquisition (BFPL).TCITransport Corporation of India (TCI) is one of the largest well-integrated players in the organised logistics industry providing freight, supply chain, warehousing solutions & shipping services.

Given strong earnings outlook, we continue to remain positive on the stock.Top sectors which will lead the next leg of the rally on India markets?As per our coverage, these are the sectors on which we are positive...NBFCThe rural economy is improving on the back of two consecutive normal monsoons which enhances the outlook and bodes well for NBFCs across consumer durables, SME and auto financing.Further, reducing the cost of funds, re-monetisation and new avenues of growth will continue to drive strong performance for NBFCs. We also like the housing finance space which will see large benefits flowing from government’s push for affordable housing.We, therefore, expect the sector to continue its outperformance and prefer NBFCs with stable operating performance with steady asset quality.CementThe industry had been in a stage of high capacity additions during the last one decade (increased from 157MT in FY06 to current ~421MT) which has come down subsequently due to subdued demand growth owing to slower progress in infrastructure projects, low off-take from the housing sector and excess capacities in various industrial sectors.We forecast low additions in new capacity over the next 2 years at ~25MT which coupled with a revival in demand on account of enhanced focus of GoI on housing and infra will lead cement demand & supply gap to narrow in the coming years.InfrastructureIncrease in government spending on infra space will create a positive sentiment to the sector, which was in doldrums for a period of time. Further, road sector is the bright spot in the infrastructure space.The government continued to focus on road infrastructure with an ambitious target to build 41 km per day in FY18 has kept the sector on a sound wicket.On the other hand, increased capex of Rs 1.31 lakh crore for constructing new railway tracks, doubling, electrification, gauge conversion will give ample opportunities for railway EPC players.Moving swiftly in the pursuit of affordable ‘Power for All’, the power sector is likely to witness major changes in a budgeted allocation to Rs 106 billion for integrated power Development and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana.ChemicalsTill recently, major global chemical giants met their sourcing requirements from China due to lower cost and favorable currency.However, during recent times, there is a higher regulatory compliance requirement in China which has led MNCs to diversify their RM sourcing arrangement from China and adding India as an additional sourcing destination.Govt. initiatives in the form of port-based Chemical Parks in SEZ, improvement in infrastructure, tax concessions; rationalization of duty structure, FDI relaxation, etc. would facilitate further growth of Indian chemical industry into a major chemical hub.DefenceThere is a major push from the government to reduce the import dependence to 30 percent from current 60 percent-70 percent. In line with this objective, high priority is given to defence under “Make in India” initiative.As a result of this, we are witnessing a higher order flows towards domestic companies and improved traction in terms of government intent towards finalizing delayed large orders.PharmaDuring the last 1-2 months, we have slowly shifted our view on pharma sector from neutral to positive. This is due to the recent positive regulatory responses received from US FDA for certain pharma companies.The valuations of those companies are very attractive in that it is almost impossible to avoid such businesses from a long-term perspective. The pharma sector is most likely to stabilise over the next 1 to 2 years.""]"

The sentiments on Indian markets are very positive. Technical studies suggest we are targeting 11500 levels. Minor corrections are still an opportunity to Buy,” he said.Commenting on the Budget, Nadeem expects that LTCG might be taken care by Government since benefits of Zero rate are far more than that of Taxing investors.

For instance, stocks such as Sintex, Reliance Communications, Siti Networks, Bank of Maharashtra, Aban Offshore, and IDBI Bank have all given double-digit negative returns in the past 10 years. So, there is a good chance that if you have held these stocks in the past decade, it would not have made investors happy.Going forward, experts do see better times for the market, but they also caution on some downside risks.“Indian markets will attract global attention once earnings growth visibility improves. So much wealth creation has happened globally across markets, typically some part of that wealth has the potential to get allocated to emerging markets like India, though it is difficult to gauge the timing or extent of that,” Hemang Jani, Head - Advisory, Sharekhan toldMoneycontrol. Among downside risks, he believes macro story not playing out and earnings cycle taking longer time to revive could hit the market.']"

In the current Bull Run, we have not yet entered the phase where the actual earnings outpace estimated earnings resulting in positive surprise on earnings, which was observed during the FY05- FY07 phase,” ICICI Securities said in a note.“In this context, we believe it is unlikely that growth will surprise on the upside in CY18 and, against the backdrop of stretched valuations and evolving risks, equity returns could be moderate,” it said.Rolling forward to Mar’20 EPS, ICICI Securities revised its 1-year forward target for the Nifty50 index stands at 11,750 (based on+0.5 s.d. forward P/E multiple of 17.2x and Mar’20 EPS of Rs 682).']"

Well, the answer is a Yes as well as No. Yes, the momentum will continue. And, No because indices might not able to give a similar return of 29 percent in the year 2018.The Nifty clocked whopping gains of 29% in the calendar year 2017 and probably we can count on the fingers of our one hand such spectacular years in the history of Indian markets. It is still a buy on dips market and investors should use every dip to buy quality stocks.“Undoubtedly, the year belongs to mighty bulls as we saw massive wealth creation right from the word go. There were a couple of hiccups during the year; but they eventually turned out to be whipsaws as the index kept on enjoying its Bull Run to eventually conclude the year at record highs,” Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst- Technical Derivatives, Angel Broking Pvt Ltd told Moneycontrol.related newsBuy Coal India, Dish TV, DHFL; sell Bank of Baroda: Prakash GabaBuy RIL, Berger Paints, IndusInd Bank, NCC; sell PNB, Bank of Baroda: Ashwani GujralL&T Infotech top pick in midcap IT space, raise target price by 33%: Macquarie“If we look at it from a longer perspective then there is no second thought about the continuation of this Bull Run towards 11000 and beyond. But, we do not expect the journey to be as smooth as it has been throughout this year,” he said.Any decent declines during the year remain to be a good buying opportunity for investors having longer-term horizon. On the downside, 10460 – 10426 are the levels to watch out for.There were many such occasion in the past since 1980 when the market has continued to deliver in the subsequent year even after clocking 25 percent plus kind of returns. But, analyst advises investors to remain stock specific and be contrarian in their approach.“Adopting a contrarian strategy can be better for a bet for the year 2018 which should reward investors in case market turns out to be very volatile and turbulent,” Mazhar Mohammad, Chief Strategist – Technical Research & Trading Advisory, Chartviewindia.in told Moneycontrol.“If we dissect the long-term trends then we will know that this market is staring at a critical resistance level placed around 10,650 and in need of a breakout,” he said.Mohammad further added that for bigger up moves, the index needs to witness a sustainable breakout above the said level. “In case such a breakout takes place, then bulls can easily take the indices to much higher levels and may even head towards 11,200 levels on the Nifty,” he said.Here is a list of top 10 stocks which can give up to 70% in the next 12 months:Brokerage Firm: ICICIdirectBharti Airtel: BUY| Target Rs688| Return 29%The stock recorded a multi-fold rally from March 2003 low of 16 to the December 2007 high of Rs592. The share price of Bharti Airtel retraced 61.8% Fibonacci level of entire four and half years dynamic up move.Since then it has been consolidating in a broader range of Rs216 – 452 for the past 10 years, advocating healthy price and time correction. The recent developments on price front indicate structural change as it is on the conclusion of the 10 years corrective phase and signal resumption of the primary uptrend.The breakout was supported by the strong volume of more than double of the 12 months average volume of 10 crore share per month signalling larger participation in the direction of the trend.As per change in polarity concept, the earlier swing high of 450 would act as an immediate support for the stock. The aforementioned technical evidence suggests that the stock is gearing up for the move to novel orbit.We expect the share price to surpass the lifetime high of a Rs592 level and head towards Rs688 levels in the long term as it is the measuring implication of range breakout (452-216=236 points) added to the breakout area of Rs452 project upside towards Rs688 (452+236=688).Axis Bank: BUY| Target Rs640| Return 14%The consolidation in the broad range of Rs547-480 of the last nine months is approaching maturity as the stock is at the cusp of a breakout from the recent consolidation pattern.We believe the current consolidation has approached maturity and the stock is likely to resume its prior uptrend.The share price of Axis Bank after the strong up move in the CY14 has been trading in a range in the last three years while consuming 33 months in retracing just 61.8% of the previous 13 months rally from Rs217 to Rs654 signalling a healthy consolidation and a robust price structure.The stock has major support around Rs485-490 range as it is a confluence of the long-term trendline support joining the lows since CY14 as can be seen in the adjacent chart and the base of the recent consolidation.We expect the share price to resolve higher from hereon and head towards Rs640 levels in the medium term as it is the 161.8% extension of the previous up move (Rs425-547) as projected from a recent trough of Rs448, which also coincides with the high of September 2016.Punjab National Bank: BUY| Target Rs230| Return 34%The share price of PNB is on the verge of the conclusion of correction in the secondary phase. The last seven years correction has been captured in a well-defined downward sloping channel formation, where the fall from December 2010 highs of Rs280 to lower high of December 2014 of Rs231.It correspondingly matches with lows of September 2013 of Rs80 followed by March 2016 low of Rs69. On the monthly chart is that the stock witnessed faster retracement where it retraced last six-month descent in solely one month’s up move.Another important observation is that the stock has recorded highest ever quarterly volumes since March 2004 along with robust price move, suggesting structural change is on cards in the stock and offers a fresh opportunity for investors to ride the next leg of up move.We expect the stock to find strong support in the region of 140 as it is the value area of key uptrend line connecting May 2016 and October 2017 swing lows.Based on the aforementioned technical observations, we expect the stock to enter into a sustainable uptrend and head towards the target of Rs230 being the price parity with the previous up move from Rs69 to Rs165 added to the recent trough of Rs129, project upside towards Rs225 which coincide with October 2017 peak of Rs231.Tata Chemicals: BUY| Target Rs878| Return 20%In the first quarter of CY17, Tata Chemical logged a resolute breakout from multi-year resistance trend line drawn adjoining June 1996 highs of Rs306 and subsequent highs of January 2008 of 431.After registering this breakout, share price retested the breakout level and sustained well above it for a couple of months. While analysing medium-term chart we observed conventional up move, as the price continues to form higher high along with strong momentum and the corrections are getting shallower, which resembles ‘Flag’ breakout.A Flag is a bullish continuation pattern, suggesting that the stock is ready to make new highs. Correspondingly, the quarterly MACD (E-12/26/9) has rallied to highest reading as it continues to make rising peak and trough formation, complementing the price rallies.The volume behaviour also supports the positive bias in the stock. We believe the stock is attractively poised above the major breakout area and provides a good buying opportunity from a medium-term perspective.We expect the stock to head towards our target of Rs878 levels in the long term being the price parity of the previous major up move from Rs568 to Rs765 added to the recent trough of Rs681 projects upside towards Rs878.EIH: BUY| Target Rs183| Return 24%Post retracement of 50 percent of earlier major fall of January 2008 – August 2013 the share price of EIH limited had been oscillating in a broader range of 91- 137 for more than two years. In the second quarter of CY17, stock logged a resolute breakout above the upper band of the range and has been consolidating above the breakout level in the last three months signaling strength in the breakout and provides fresh entry opportunity.The sharp rebound from the December 2016 low of Rs91 has seen the stock completely retrace its preceding 24 months down fall (Rs138 to Rs91) in just 5 months, thus confirming a faster retracement.Faster retracement of the last consolidation highlights the strong demand emerging at the major breakout level. The monthly momentum indicator MACD (E-12/26/9) found support from zero levels and now inching upward indicating strength in the current momentum.We believe the current consolidation above the breakout area of Rs138 is a positive sign confirming strength in the price breakout as the stock is building a higher base that will act as the launch pad for a further northward journey.We expect the stock to head towards Rs183 levels in the long term as it is the measuring implication of range breakout (Rs137-91=46 points) added to the breakout area of Rs137 project upside towards Rs183 (137+46=183).Analyst Name: Pragnesh Jain, Technical analyst, Systematix SharesAdani EnterprisesLtd: BUY| Target Rs261| Return 57%The stock formed a Cup & Handle breakout which is a continuation pattern. Formation of the pattern suggests that the stock is likely to continue its uptrend recorded in the year 2017.The pattern suggests that the stock has upside potential of over 60 percent from current levels. We see the stock hitting Rs261 in the next 12 months. Any dip towards Rs160 can be used as a buying opportunity. Investors can keep a stop loss below Rs140 on a closing basis.Tata PowerLtd: BUY| Target Rs135| Return 45%The stock witnessed a Triangle breakout on the monthly charts along with the recent upmove within an upward sloping channel suggest that the stock has potential to hit Rs120 followed by 135.Investors can use dips towards Rs85 as a buying opportunity with a stop loss firmly placed below Rs78 on closing basis.ABB IndiaLtd: BUY| Target Rs1900| Return 35%The stock has given a triangle breakout after making multiple bottoms near Rs1300 levels. Triangle breakout suggests that the stock has upside potential of Rs1700, followed by Rs1900 with a stop loss firmly placed below Rs1300.Elecon EngineeringLtd: BUY| Target Rs180| Return 76%The stock has been trading within a range since 2009. The range breakout at Rs101 along with a monthly, quarterly as well as yearly close above the breakout (on all major time frames) suggests that the stock has upside potential of Rs146 followed by 180.Investors can use dips towards Rs97 as a buying opportunity with a stop loss below Rs80.HexawareLtd: BUY| Target Rs430| Return 26%The stock formed a Pole & Flag breakout pattern which is a continuation pattern. A breakout above Rs345 levels will lead to the upside potential of Rs430 with a stop loss placed below Rs314.Disclaimer:The views and investment tips expressed by brokerage firms on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

Initial gains led by Reliance Industries and telecom stocks were wiped out\xa0by a sharp fall in banks following weakAxis Bankearnings in the later part of the truncated week. The Nifty closed down 0.21 percent at 10,146.55, after hitting a record high of 10,251.85 on October 17. The Sensex also touched an all-time high of 32,699.86 in Diwali week.Consolidation is likely to rule in the coming week (the first week of Samvat 2074), especially due to expiry of futures & options on Thursday. Any major uptrend or downtrend from hereon will largely depend on earnings (especially banks), experts feel. Major banks, and index heavyweightsInfosysandITCwill announce earnings during the week.According to experts, if banks disappoint the Street with weak quarterly earnings particularly indicating continued asset quality concerns then there could be further fall in the market. Most experts, however, do firmly believe the asset quality woes will\xa0ease during the next financial year. Banking sector has maximum weightage in the Sensex and Nifty.This earnings season will also be closely watched for the impact of GST implemented on July 1.

I am sure the effect of demonetisation on the economy will fade out over the next year and even the positive aspects of GST will be clearly visible clearly in the earnings,"" Gagdani said.In the passing week, index heavyweights came to the rescue when the major banking index came under pressure. For the coming expiry week, this trend is expected to continue, ICICIdirect feels. Declines in the Nifty should be taken as a buying opportunity, he advised.Here are 10 things that will keep investors busy next week:-EarningsSeptember quarter earnings season started off on a positive note but Axis Bank earnings - the major one - announced before Diwali was disappointing and hit market sentiment.The flow of results announcement was bit slow due to Diwali holiday in the week gone by but in the coming week, about 182 companies (as per BSE data) will release their earnings for the quarter ended September 2017. Major ones among them would be Infosys, HDFC Bank, Yes Bank, ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, IOC, ITC, HCL Technologies, ONGC, HUL, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Asian Paints, Ambuja Cements, ABB India, Zee Entertainment, L&T Finance, M&M Financial, Mindtree, RBL Bank, Biocon, Jubilant Foodworks, Canara Bank, Adani Transmission and Bharat Financial.InfosysInfosys, which normally kicks off the earnings season, postponed its results announcement date. It will deliver results for July-September quarter on October 24, around 15:45 hours IST.The key thing to watch out for would be commentary from new interim CEO UB Pravin Rao and Co-founder Nandan Nikekani who was appointed as Non-Executive Chairman of the company on August 24, after Vishal Sikka resigned as CEO and MD.""Key issues to watch out for would be an update on internal stability of the company; commentary around contribution of newly launched services, and revenue scale and growth from products and solutions; and commentary around macro, verticals, margins and pricing,"" Motilal Oswal said.Motilal Oswal expects Infosys to report 2 percent growth in constant currency revenue in Q2 QoQ while ICICIdirect sees constant currency revenue growth at 2.5 percent QoQ against 2.7 percent in Q1.The country\'s second largest software company had been in focus due to the fight between the board members and Co-founder Narayana Murthy over corporate governance standards.BanksBanks earnings will be in focus, especially after Axis Bank, the country\'s third largest private sector lender, recorded a sharp rise in slippages that increased its non-performing assets sharply. Nifty Bank fell nearly 700 points in three consecutive sessions.Asset quality will be key to watch for. Profit of majority of banks may be higher due to a low base in the year-ago quarter that was hit by higher provisions.ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Yes Bank, Canara Bank, IDFC Bank, RBL Bank and Vijaya Bank will announce their July-September quarter earnings in the coming week.Most experts, before Q2 earnings, expect the asset quality to improve from the fourth quarter (FY18) onwards.

On the medium-to-long term perspective, they see Nifty crossing 10,500 level.“Going forward, we expect the index to remain on a rising trajectory and extend the up-move towards 10,600 in coming months. The measuring implication of the bullish Double Bottom pattern (10,170 to 9,700 = 470 points) added to the breakout point of 10,170 projects upsides toward 10,600 regions over the coming months,” Dharmesh Shah – Head Technical, ICICI Direct.com Research said.Atul Suri, Chief Investment Officer at Marathon Trends PMS, sees near-term pain for the market if Nifty Bank underperforms which could lead to some consolidation in the market.

The index has already corrected its October rally (9,687-10,490) by 50 percent amid profit booking in recently run up stocks.We believe current round of profit booking will make the market healthier by working off short-term overbought conditions as suggested by a daily stochastic oscillator which has plunged to an extreme oversold reading of 5 and thereby creating a fresh buying opportunity.We expect the Nifty to find the support in the vicinity of 10,000-10,100 as it is the confluence of key retracements and equality with preceding decline (10,178-9,687).related newsBuy Coal India, Dish TV, DHFL; sell Bank of Baroda: Prakash GabaBuy RIL, Berger Paints, IndusInd Bank, NCC; sell PNB, Bank of Baroda: Ashwani GujralL&T Infotech top pick in midcap IT space, raise target price by 33%: MacquarieGoing forward, we expect the index to enter into a consolidation zone of 10,000-10,300 and eventually head higher towards 10,600 in the coming month.The overall price structure remains bullish as the index continues to form rising peaks and troughs in the weekly/monthly time frame.The most recent October rally (9,687 to 10,490 = 803 points) was larger in magnitude compared to last rising segment of July-August 2017, measuring 689 points.The rallies are now getting bigger which highlights persistent demand at elevated levels. It augurs well for the continuance of the up move going forward.Here is a list of top 3 stocks which could give up to 19% return in 6 months:Abbott India: BUY| CMP Rs4982| Target Rs5950| Stop Loss Rs4495| Return 19%| Time Frame 6 monthThe share price of Abbott India has undergone a healthy corrective phase over the past two years and now looks poised to resume its primary uptrend, thus providing a fresh entry opportunity from a medium-term time horizon.The share price has been in a corrective phase since its September 2015 peak of Rs6177 as it retraced its three-fold rally during 2014-2015.After early signs of bottoming formation near the key support of Rs4000, the share price rallied above an intermediate swing high of Rs5040 during current week resulting in a faster retracement of last falling segment.A faster retracement of falling segment indicates culmination of corrective phase and revival of bullish bias in the stock.The share price retraced its 11-month corrective decline (Rs5040-4001) in just two months, thus signaling turnaround in price structure and offers fresh entry opportunity.We expect the stock to resolve higher and challenge its life high of Rs6177 over the medium term. The pattern implication of past eighteen-month consolidation breakout also provides a target in the vicinity of Rs6000 (consolidation range 5000-4000=1000 points) projected above the breakout levels of Rs5000.GlaxoSmithKline Consumer: BUY| CMP – 6010| Target Rs6700| Stop Loss Rs5680| Return 12%| Time Frame 6 monthsThe share price of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer remains in a structural uptrend as it continues to stride northward in a rising peaks and troughs manner.Currently, the stock is seen emerging out of a two-year-long corrective phase that forms part of the larger degree uptrend. We believe the stock is set to embark upon its next major up move, going forward.Therefore, it provides a good buying opportunity for medium term investors. The stock entered into a secondary corrective phase after hitting a lifetime high of Rs6800 in December 2015.The price wise correction halted precisely near the key value area of Rs4900 being the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement of the 2013-15 rally (Rs3800 to Rs6800).The stock witnessed a steady base formation around Rs4850-4900 region towards the end of 2016 before gradually rising to a high of Rs5780 by August 2017. The ensuing correction saw the share price once again revisit the value area of Rs4850-4900 in September 2017.The two identical lows formed in December 2016 and September 2017 represent a bullish Double Bottom formation highlighting strong demand at the key value area.We believe the stock has concluded a healthy corrective phase and is set to embark upon its next up move going forward.We expect the stock to head towards our target of Rs6700 in the medium term as it is the measuring implication of the Double Bottom pattern i.e. the neckline and base of the pattern (5780-4850=930 points) added to the breakout point of Rs5780 projects upside towards | 6700JK Cement: BUY| CMP Rs1053| Target Rs1175| Stop Loss Rs1015| Return 12%| Time Frame 1 monthsThe stock remains in a well-established uptrend and continues to inch northwards in a rising peaks and troughs manner in the monthly chart.Within this structural uptrend, the stock has undergone periodic phases of consolidation providing fresh entry opportunities for investors to ride the uptrend.The two distinct lows of July 2017 and September 2017 placed around Rs923 region represent a Double Bottom formation, which is a bullish reversal pattern highlighting the strong demand at the key value area of the long-term 52 weeks EMA currently placed at Rs935 levels.The strong up move in the current week's trade has seen the stock register a resolute breakout above the neckline of the double bottom pattern signaling fresh entry opportunity.We expect the stock to head towards Rs1235 levels over the coming month being the measuring implication of the double bottom pattern i.e. the neckline and base of the pattern (1079-923=156 points) added to the breakout point of Rs1079 projects upside towards Rs1235Disclaimer:The author is Head Technical, AVP at ICICI Direct.com Research.

The research house expects crude oil to trade in range of USD 55-65 a barrel, global growth to continue, reforms (GST, IBC, RERA, road projects worth Rs 7 lakh crore, Rs 2.11 lakh crore PSU banks\' recapitalisation, affordable housing, etc) announced in last two years to show results and rural growth which was lagging to be seen going ahead, which will create conducive growth environment for the country.""Modi government\'s five reforms would see the results starting 2018 putting India in a \'Stronger for longer\' position,"" Patil said.He further said the higher ranking in \'ease of doing business\' and Moody\'s India upgrade also gave strong confidence to investors.Last year, global rating agency Moody\'s after raising India\'s rating by a notch to Baa2 (after 13 years) had said reforms implemented to date would advance the government\'s objective of improving the business climate, enhancing productivity, stimulating foreign and domestic investment, and ultimately fostering strong and sustainable growth.The reform program would thus complement the existing shock-absorbance capacity provided by India\'s strong growth potential and improving global competitiveness, it added.Other positives that Aditya Birla Capital pointed out are consumption growth (due to low interest rates, 7th pay commission, lower GST rates, farm loan waiver, recovery in rural) is expected to drive GDP; likely pick up in private capex; likely long term liquidity support to market on the downside; stability in inflation; comfortable current account deficit (led by foreign flows & forex reserves); and stability in rupee (around 61-66 to US dollar).The investment firm expects India to remain an investment destination for foreigners due to growth opportunities it provides at the back of strong economy and currency.Mutual fund industry, which has seen average monthly inflow run rate of Rs 19,000 crore in 2017, is expected to see at least Rs 10,000 crore monthly inflow in current year, the firm said.It also believes the NSE Nifty which rallied 29 percent on hopes of recovery is not in a bubble territory and will look cheaper as earnings recover going ahead. In fact, the Nifty has merit in trading at premium valuations compared to historical averages and also 2008 peak, it said.""Considering other parameters like P/B, P/S, dividend yield etc, there is no froth in the markets. Infact, IIP, eight core industries and other indicators point to bottom of the cycle is behind and the economy is recovering. Composition of Nifty50 index has also changed with more weightage to non-cyclical sectors. Hence, it commands more valuation than in the past,"" it further explained.But... if all these things go for a toss, which means earnings & economic recovery do not happen, reforms do not work out, crude increases sharply, geo-political risks arise, US specific risks pop up (political, reforms, tax), China growth slows down etc, though are unlikely, then that could be a bigger risk for 12-15 percent market return expectations, Mahesh Patil said while answering to Moneycontrol.Aditya Birla Capital believes with lower bond yields & fixed deposit rates and falling real estate & gold prices, equities (with reasonable valuations & good expected earnings) provide good alternative for investment with a horizon for three plus years.The key themes which it expects to play in 2018 are financials, consumer staples (food beverages, household items, tobacco etc), consumer discretionary (durable goods, auto etc), infrastructure and telecom.Disclosure: Reliance Industries Ltd. is the sole beneficiary of Independent Media Trust which controls Network18 Media & Investments Ltd.']"

Here's an excerpt from that interview:2017 has been a great year for Indian equities as the market grew by around 25 percent. Do you see same kind of rally in 2018 also and what is your Nifty target for December 2018?We expect the healthy run-up in the global equity markets, including India, seen this year to continue in 2018 with average of more than 18-20 percent return in India. This is all because domestic money dictating the growth trend and expect to continue going forward.Indian markets are much more in control of their own destiny wherein historically FIIs were the price/trend-setters. We see year 2018 has much more to say on election saga, usually the main reason for volatility. Barring to the election outcome the domestic inflow and government reforming action will keep markets on northward movement.Prashanth TapseAssociate Vice President (Research)|Mehta EquitiesBudget Reactions: Budget 2013 landed in no man's land:Mehta EquitiesRailway Budget 2013: Fiscal sustainability vital for Rlys: Mehta EquitiesOn over basis market is bullish on the current government focused towards increase in spending. We see growth momentum improves in the year prior to the elections, a trend which is likely to play out in this cycle as well. Based on the facts and assumption we see Nifty target near 11,500 -11,900 on or before December 2018.What are the next key events (or themes) to watch out for the year 2018? Kindly explain events or themes in 100-150 words if possible. Will those events drive the market up or down?We see multiple events to trigger 2018 outlook likewise Budget, State Elections and earning hiccups.1) UnionBudget 2018holds special significance being the first Budget to be presented in the post-GST era. While we expect it would be a “POPULIST BUDGET” ahead of a stream of assembly elections next year, the Budget may see more focus on common man dreamer’s Budget like common Man’s Tax revision, high allocation to agriculture sector, spending more on infra capex development and emphasis on defence spending which will make generate energy for future growth.2) Elections would be the key volatile theme for 2018, after Budget the battle starts from congress ruled Karnataka which will raise market sentiments and any outcome would only disturb short lived trends while strong confidence in equity performance will be overruled.3) We expect solid earnings growth delivery in the next year and the following year and see that as a credible backdrop for India to continue to perform well. Earning performance will be supported by pick-up in investment and easing of financial conditions.The domestic liquidity supported markets in the year 2017. Will that liquidity support continue in 2018 as well or do you see some tapering of flows? What is your view on FIIs flow?Domestic money is dictating the growth trend and expects this to continue going forward. After Modi took charge since then the investor confidence indicator has only raised upwards. We are seeing a positive correlation between mutual fund equity inflows and stock market performance which was not the case a couple of years ago.The upsurge in mutual fund equity flows has given a new connotation to Indian equity markets. Considering the huge MF inflow on month-on-month basis which is supporting markets for any hiccups, we believe demonetisation, GST, digitalisation and the increasing preference for equity as an asset class have emerged as the mega trends in India.FIIs have deep pockets and they are bullish on Indian markets. They actually act based on the performance of the economy, corporate earnings and market momentum. We believe Indian story can’t be ignored if they want to earn the best in asset class returns in next 2 years.India Inc raised over USD 11 billion through IPOs in 2017. Will 2018 be another golden year of IPOs?In the recent times, IPO’s has been in high demand. 2017 was the golden year for all the companies which raised money through this route and a few of the IPOs have tripled investor wealth in 2017 alone.We expect the same trend to continue in 2018 as various government policies are favouring to facilitate businesses and creating opportunity to garner funds from the capital market by issuing shares.Also, a surge in the secondary market has encouraged many companies to go to public in search of better valuations. Undoubtedly, the IPO market has rewarded investors with healthy returns and is expected that it would continue to perform in 2018 as well.Everyone is saying corporate earnings were far better-than-expected in September quarter. Do you see December quarter earnings laying foundation stone of earnings recovery?Yes, September quarter earnings was far better-than-expected as market was anticipating the demonetization and GST effect to rerate earnings expectations. We see there is hope of a better second half earnings growth with low base created by demonetisation/GST action.Nevertheless, risks remain for expectations of a lower double digit earnings growth for FY18 as the same has been nearly flat in the first half and entire burden has now shifted to second half. On overall basis earnings growth will come from Q3, which will drive markets.The next big event the market will watch out for will beUnion Budget. What are you key expectations from the last full-fledged Budget. After Gujarat elections there are as many as 8 state assembly elections lined up before general elections in the year 2019. Do you see a change in tactics of the Modi government or a policy shift in policy framework – from reformist to populist?Budget 2018would be the key game changer event to government keeping in mind the state elections and as well as the 2019 Lok Sabha election.Key expectations from POPULIST BUDGET would be more focused on creating employment and employment-related funding, rural population and farmers, capital expenditure on infrastructure as government next year will be on the momentum of infrastructure creation.After Gujarat elections saga, the government will be more alert in handing the forth coming elections. We expect this upcoming Budget will also keep elections in mind and tactically present some reforms or policy shift which would affect the election outcome.The BJP may be optimistic about its prospects in the Karnataka assembly elections after winning the Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, hence we are highly optimistic on the Modi Govt to manage the elections and expect government would now be emboldened to go full throttle on making policy / reforms which are believed to be the bane of the Indian economy.Top five sectors which you think stand to gain the most from the upcomingBudget 2018?We believe this Budget, government with focus more on sectors which are the base of economic growth interns of employment, raising income levels, infrastructure and raising spending capex areas.Sectors we like are agriculture, defence, oil & gas, power and banking. These sectors are growing well and would continue to be on the growth trajectory.As we moved to 2018, what are your 5 best picks for 2018?Chennai Petroleum| CMP - Rs 421 | Target - Rs 600 | Upside – 42.5%Chennai Petroleum Corporation (CPCL) is a subsidiary of Indian Oil Corporation and is one of the premier Public Sector Undertaking engaged in the business of crude oil refining and in the production of fuel products, lubricants and petrochemical feed stocks.Investment rationale:• Resid upgradation project at Manali refinery expected to improve GRM• Mega expansion on cards: New 9mntpa refinery at Cauvery Basin Refinery• Building of Re gasification LNG terminal project Dharma Port Gas Facility• Laid down a new 42inch diameter crude oil pipeline from Chennai Port Trust to Manali Refinery which will replace their existing 45 years old 30 inch crude oil pipeline.Zen Technologies| CMP - Rs 147 | Target - Rs 200 | Upside – 36%Zen Technologies is a three decade old company involved in designing, developing and manufacturing of world class training solutions.

""The results season looks to have turned to the positive, overall outlook for the economy is also again changing to the positive. Domestic inflows continue to be robust, whereas FII activity remains lackluster,"" he reasoned.For the week, the Nifty gained 1.25 percent and the Sensex increased 1.6 percent while Nifty Midcap rose 2.3 percent.Going forward, one of the major triggers that the Street could watch out for is the earnings season. Names like State Bank of India, M&M, Aurobindo Pharma, Tata Motors and RCom, among others are set to announce their earnings. On the global front, while North Korea tensions seem to have steadied for now, the Street will still be cautious on any statements from either Washington or Pyongyang could keep it on its feet.EarningsWith the earnings season in its thick phase, the Street shall await data from the upcoming results this week. According to experts, the market has been waiting for some kind of earnings growth to justify the valuations that they are trading at. So far, they added, the numbers have not disappointed and have been steady.In the upcoming week, over 800 BSE companies will be declaring their results between November 4 and November 11, 2017.Among the big and popular names include Inox Wind, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, Century Textiles & Industries, Fortis Malar Hospitals, Housing And Urban Development Corporation, Just Dial, Narayana Hrudayalaya, Torrent Power, Varun Beverages, Welspun Corp, Westlife Development, Aditya Birla Capital, Cipla, Future Retail, Jyothy Laboratories, MAS Financial Services, Mahanagar Gas, Snowman Logistics, Aurobindo Pharma, India Cements, Tata Motors, V-Mart Retail, Bosch, Mahindra & Mahindra, State Bank Of India, and Reliance Communications, among others.IPO and ListingIn the primary market action, another company will hit the exchanges—HDFC Standard Life on November 7. It would be interesting to watch the kind of response this insurer gets after the performances of GIC Re and SBI Life, among others.Meanwhile, the Street will also watch out for actions on the new listing front. Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management’s shares will make their market debut on Monday, making it the first AMC to list on Indian exchanges.Corporate ActionAmong corporates several companies will be meeting to declare their dividends and their record dates as well. For instance, companies such as Supreme Industries, Gillette India, Dabur, Mastek, Symphony Industries, Godrej Consumer Products and Power Finance Corporation, among others, will be ex-dividend, among others. The Street could take a note of that development and the stock could react accordingly.Meanwhile, a company such as Indraprastha Gas (IGL) could also be in focus as the company goes ex-split from Rs 10 apiece to Rs 2 per share.Stocks in FocusThe Street could keep a few stocks in focus on the back of developments after the close of market hours on Friday.The Enforcement Directorate issued summons to Saregama Music and T-series for not alleged money laundering charges. The ED registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.A few of the infrastructure companies could also be on investors’ radar after the National Highways Authority of India’s (NHAI) decision. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has terminated 20 road development contracts citing default. NHAI has also barred some major infra players from bidding for highway projects in the next 2-3 years for public-private partnership (PPP) projects and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) projects, which received major funding from the government.The companies that are barred include L&T, Hindustan Construction Company (HCC), Essel Infra Projects, MBL Infra, JKM Infra, Madhucon Toll Highways, Supreme Infra, Transtroy India and others. These firms have been given time till November 6 to make representation before NHAI.Meanwhile, Unichem Labs and Torrent Pharma will be in focus after an acquisition was announced by Torrent Pharma post market hours on Friday. The deal is said to be for a consideration of Rs 3,600 crore.Titan could be in focus after it reported robust performance for the quarter ended September 2017 as consolidated profit showed a whopping 67.4 percent growth, driven by jewellery business. Its profit for the quarter increased to Rs 278 crore, from Rs 166 crore in corresponding quarter last fiscal.Global CuesOn the global front, news from North Korea is likely to be on investors\' radar even as the Street looks to price in any untoward events. US President Donald Trump will also leave for a multi-nation tour.Apart from that, cues are largely muted as global markets too look to focus on domestic earnings and macro data as well.Technical FactorsTechnical experts highlight that the candle formation on charts indicate a positive move on the market, but a small correction is likely too.“In the coming week, if Nifty trades and closes above 10,484 levels then it is likely to test 10,525-10,565-10,612 levels. However, if the Nifty trades and closes below 10,420 level then it can test 10379 – 10339 - 10292 levels.SBI earnings in focusThe September quarter results for State Bank of India will be out later this week. The index heavyweight’s numbers will be tracked by the Street and this will be the second quarter after the amalgamation of associate banks has taken place. The bank had reported a 20.4 percent de-growth in standalone profit at Rs 2,005.53 crore, dented by higher provisions. Asset quality including subsidiaries also worsened further. Standalone net interest income grew by 22 percent to Rs 17,606.01 crore compared with corresponding quarter of previous fiscal. Standalone numbers included SBI and its associate banks (that merged from April 1, 2017) while consolidated numbers include banking as well as other businesses (insurance, other banking operations etc).Tata Motors ResultsThough the previous quarter was saved largely due to a one-time gain, Tata Motors’ Q2 show will be watched by investors, which are likely to factor in festive demand as well. Investors will keep a note on the results of this stock.Its first quarter earnings missed analysts\' expectations on all parameters on Wednesday. One-time gain related to JLR pension plan boosted profitability but excluding that one-off item, it would have been in a loss due to forex losses. Consolidated profit grew sharply by 41.6 percent year-on-year to Rs 3,200 crore, driven by one-time gain of Rs 3,609 crore relating to recent changes designed to improve the sustainability of JLR\'s defined benefit pension plans.L&T resultsAmid talks of a push to infrastructure companies, the market will also await results from L&T for the September quarter as operationally, the company had posted a subdued quarter.The index heavyweight’s results matched analysts\' expectations on bottomline as well as topline front but operational numbers in Q1 missed estimates. Profit during the quarter grew by 46.4 percent to Rs 892.5 crore in the quarter ended June 2017, aided by lower tax that has fallen 16.2 percent YoY. Revenue rose by 9.7 percent to Rs 23,990 crore year-on-year, driven by infrastructure business that contributed 44 percent to total revenue.Macro DataOn the domestic front, money supply data will be declared later during the week, which will help in understanding the liquidity situation in the country. Over and above this, global cues will also be in focus. Data for European PMI (services and manufacturing), Chinese imports, US crude imports, and CPI data for China, among others will also be declared this week.']"

At that stage, promoter is desperate to resolve as it is in his interest otherwise he or she loses control of the company. But resolution beforehand requires bankers to A. sacrifice reasonably and unconditionally and B. there are lot of unknown liabilities. There is an apprehension that if I resolve before NCLT, there will be lot of loose ends.”Loose ends, or what he calls, the unknown liabilities which are not necessarily in promoters’ control – service tax dues, labour dues, operational creditors, electricity, etc… “I don’t even know if I will get the entire leftover price after the resolution as there could be lot of hidden dues... Hence, why settle for less?”So far, interested buyers including foreign funds such as London-based Arcelor Mittal, Brookfields, Korea’s POSCO, Blackstone, TPG Capital and domestic biggies\xa0like the Tata Group, Kotak Group, Mumbai-based Shapoorji Pallonji Group, Ajay Piramal-controlled Piramal Enterprises and Sajjan Jindal’s JSW Group, among a few have\xa0shown interest to buy the stressed assets currently battling the insolvency process at various NCLTs.The Dirty DozenOf these, the 12 accounts in the first list include -- Essar Steel, Bhushan Steel, Bhushan Power and Steel, Monnet Ispat and Energy, Electrosteel Steels, Lanco Infratech, Alok Industries, Amtek Auto, Jyoti Structures, Era Infra Engineering, Jaypee Infratech and ABG Shipyard.As per a Motilal Oswal report the haircut at 70 percent of net stressed loans can impact net worth of lenders by 37-100 percent. Private banks are better placed than PSU banks in terms of capital availability to absorb such potential losses. However, the government’s recapitalisation plan will enable PSU banks to make necessary provisions towards such assets.Given the substantially high debt-to-market cap levels and the first round of NCLT resolutions to be completed within 180 days (extendable up to 270 days) is due between January and March, the buyers are reluctant to enter the bids in good numbers so far.Therefore, despite having good operating assets, even if the buyers come forward to bid, the end results may see hair-cuts up to 50-70 percent for most of the 12 large accounts (11 have been referred to the NCLT).Further, in case an account goes into liquidation, the recovery rate is usually just 10-20 paise in a rupee. Hence, the lenders or investors may not get paid anything if the company goes into liquidation.Additionally, lenders are also set to file the RBI’s second list with nearly 28-30 accounts to the NCLTs with the December deadline. This also requires banks to make higher provisioning towards these accounts further hitting their balance sheets and profitability.Experts suggest the second and following rounds will start seeing more trouble coming through as they would be non-performing assets. The only way to resolve is to sell-off. In the second and third rounds, the fear is the hits will be higher, a senior banker said.What is in it for banks?Therefore, in the current scenario banks seem to have landed in a Catch 22 situation. If they manage to get a buyer, the haircut could be enormous. If they don’t, then the company goes into liquidation, which leaves them with virtually nothing on the table.The crux of the resolution is what is in it for the shareholders?Currently, the stocks of the companies are already trading at very low prices. According to experts, if the resolution goes through, the hair-cuts may leave hardly anything in hand for the creditors followed by the shareholders. If the resolution fails, and the company goes into liquidation, in most likelihood, shareholders will get nothing.However, if optimism is the way to go, the empirical progress so far indicates the IBC is likely to have a structural change in the behaviour of the borrowers, lenders and at the same time give a platform of redressal for the smallest stakeholder including employees and operational creditors against crony capitalistic corporates.']"

Hence, the lenders or investors may not get paid anything if the company goes into liquidation.Additionally, lenders are also set to file the RBI’s second list with nearly 28-30 accounts to the NCLTs with the December deadline. This also requires banks to make higher provisioning towards these accounts further hitting their balance sheets and profitability.Experts suggest the second and following rounds will start seeing more trouble coming through as they would be non-performing assets. The only way to resolve is to sell-off. In the second and third rounds, the fear is the hits will be higher, a senior banker said.What is in it for banks?Therefore, in the current scenario banks seem to have landed in a Catch 22 situation. If they manage to get a buyer, the haircut could be enormous. If they don’t, then the company goes into liquidation, which leaves them with virtually nothing on the table.The crux of the resolution is what is in it for the shareholders?Currently, the stocks of the companies are already trading at very low prices. According to experts, if the resolution goes through, the hair-cuts may leave hardly anything in hand for the creditors followed by the shareholders. If the resolution fails, and the company goes into liquidation, in most likelihood, shareholders will get nothing.However, if optimism is the way to go, the empirical progress so far indicates the IBC is likely to have a structural change in the behaviour of the borrowers, lenders and at the same time give a platform of redressal for the smallest stakeholder including employees and operational creditors against crony capitalistic corporates.']"

We are getting good number of bidders.”In June, the central bank had put out a list of 12 large corporate NPAs, accounting for 25 percent of the total bad loans in the system, to be referred to the NCLT under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).Eleven of the 12 accounts have been admitted and are undergoing the insolvency proceedings to be resolved within 180 days, which will be due by December or January. These 180 days can be extended to 270 days under the IBC.related newsTPG Global led consortium bids $1 billion for Tata Teleservices assetsGalaxy Surfactants raises Rs 281 cr from anchor investorsPrez Kovind asks youth to elect representatives with cautionOf the 12 accounts, PNB has exposure to nine accounts worth Rs 11,000 crore. Towards this, the bank has to set aside capital worth Rs 1,080 crore as incremental provisions, of which Rs 840 crore has been already provided for and Rs 340 crore will be done in the remaining two quarters.From the second list, I don’t expect more than 30 percent will be resolved, so about 70 percent would go to NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal).\xa0We have a window till December 13, if resolution doesn’t happen; 5 or 6 may be resolved, the rest may go to NCLT,” Mehta said adding the bank was comfortable on provisions towards the same.In the second RBI list sent to banks individually around August, PNB has exposure worth Rs 6,500 crore to 20 accounts of the approximately 30 accounts in the list.The 12 accounts in the first list include -- Essar Steel, Bhushan Steel, Bhushan Power and Steel, Monnet Ispat and Energy, Electrosteel Steels, Lanco Infratech, Alok Industries, Amtek Auto, Jyoti Structures, Era Infra Engineering, Jaypee Infratech and ABG Shipyard.Meanwhile, 11 of these 12 accounts have been admitted by the insolvency courts and another few of them have received interest from potential investors, including existing promoters.“If you see, basically, no creditor would like to continue with the same promoter, but participation of the promoter is equally necessary in maintaining the asset during the intervening period and create a threat to the bidder also,” Mehta said.A day ago,State Bank of IndiaChairman Rajnish Kumar also played down concerns on promoters bidding for their companies as part of the insolvency process, saying creditors will set out some preconditions before a resolution plan is finalised.“Ethically, I don’t know; but legally they are within their rights to participate,” Kumar said, speaking on the sidelines of a banking event. Among the conditions Kumar mentioned were that bidders should not be wilful defaulters; a forensic audit should clear them of any wrongdoing and finally, the quality of the resolution plan would be taken into account. “The idea will be to enhance the enterprise value and anybody who gives the maximum enterprise value will be in the interest of the enterprise itself, the lenders and the country as a whole,” Kumar had explained.According to Mehta, “The process of evaluation will be decided by the committee of creditors (CoC) and anyone who gives the highest bid will get preference. We will go by net present value. We will design uniform evaluation criteria that will be applicable to all. But we cannot deny a promoter from participating in the bidding as per the law.”KV Brahmaji Rao, Executive Director of PNB said,\xa0“No defaulters is capable of bidding alone today. He will be getting some joint venture partner or an investor and only then he will be able to bid. I don’t think defaulter bid just like others.”Stating the benefits of IBC, Mehta said, “IBC has fast-tracked the decision process... The second is legal immunity as bankers think that whatsoever decision bankers are taking is under a legal frame work that is supervised by NCLT and under IPR so bankers are more confident in taking decisions including a haircut.“(Thirdly), promoters know they can lose control over assets they have created and the equity is already wiped out. So, it is pressure on banks to take a timely decision and also on corporates; otherwise, they will lose the assets they have created.”']"
