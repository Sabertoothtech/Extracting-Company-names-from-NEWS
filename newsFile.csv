Therefore, over 90 percent of employers, across small and large companies, give less importance to college degrees compared to proficiency in skills and experience.Around 88 percent of these developers, across all age groups, rely on forums such as Stack Overflow to learn new coding languages. “This is true across age groups. Indian developers value step-by-step advice from peers who came, saw, and conquered challenges before them,” Vivek Ravisankar, co-founder and CEO of HackerRank, said in the report.There is, however, a clear age group divide between YouTube and books as the second favourite resource for learning to code. “We are on the cusp of an evolution in coding education. The very nature of learning is changing. Younger generations are flocking to YouTube while older generations prefer books to learn new skills,” Ravisankar said.More specifically, when learning a new tool, 65 percent of millennials log onto YouTube while 85 percent of Gen X prefers book to learn new skills.Python gaining popularityMajority of Indian developers know C, Java and C++ with 43 percent developers saying that Python will be the next language they wish to learn.“Python is universally the most popular language and is most loved by Indian developers while Node.js is the most loved framework,” the report says.However, popularity of a language depends on generation divide. While millennials generally like JavaScript and dislike Go, the opposite is true among 45-54 year olds.Younger developers prefer newer frameworks like AngularJS and React, while older developers prefer Vue.js.Increasingly, companies are looking at GitHub and projects to supplement resumes and evaluate skills better. “When we filtered the data by roles, we found that those in a C-level position, including founders, CTOs and VPs, valued GitHub projects more than years of experience. Prestige of degree dropped even further in importance for these folks,” he said.On the other hand, developers prefer offbeat perks from stock options, in return of their service. In India, 65 percent people surveyed said professional growth and learning opportunities was an important factor in choosing a company, while 58 percent said it was work-life balance.The findings provide a roadmap for companies and hiring managers to improve the way they hire developers. While 77 percent of hiring managers in India primarily rely on resumes to evaluate developers at the first stage of the recruiting process, nearly all say assessing skills is the hardest part of the process. While, about half of developers say that resumes are not a good reflection of their abilities.“2018 will mark the end of the resume for developers. As more and more companies across all industries are hiring software engineers, it's more important than ever to truly take the time to understand who developers are, what they’re interested in, what drives them, and what they look for in a job. Without this, hiring managers will always struggle to find the best technical people,” he said.""]"

The renewable fuel is witnessing a major retail push from the government as it is desperate to reduce the high cost of imported fuel.The ministry of road transport and highways is urging automotive companies to introduce flex engines that can run with ethanol content as high as 100 percent. Automotive manufacturers have been selling E10 cars (10% ethanol, 90% petrol) in India but the government even struggled to meet E5 till 2016.“Flex engines are those which can run on 100 percent petrol and/or 100 percent ethanol. So we will see the launch of two bikes from two big companies by end of this month. Brazil, Canada and US already have the option of ethanol and buyers there have the option of choosing between petrol and ethanol. One tonne of rice straw can produce 280 litre of ethanol,"" said Gadkari.related newsAbout 50% of developers start coding before they turn 20: ReportBilateral APAs – India’s preferred method of dispute resolutionGadkari further said that as per a new policy, which was approved by the Cabinet, India could see an increase to the tune of 50 percent in production of ethanol.“We import Rs 7 lakh crore worth of fossil fuel. We have decided that we will make second generation ethanol from cotton stalk, wheat straw, bagasse and bamboo. Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan has been looking into this and made a policy and our Cabinet has approved it. This will result in 50 percent extra production of ethanol in India,"" added Gadkari.Early daysIndian two-wheeler manufacturers have tried their hand at CNG-fueled engines in the past but there was no major headway as the technology for gas-fired bikes has not evolved and availability of the fuel still remains a hurdle. Bajaj Auto and TVS Motor Company tested two-wheelers to run on CNG. There have been launches of CNG-powered scooters wherein the Activa of Honda was\xa0modified to run on CNG.Alongside ethanol, the government is also pursuing other alternative fuels such as bio-diesel and methanol. Gadkari is betting on methanol as fuel for commercial vehicles that can be blended with a fossil fuel or directly. In some countries, methanol is even being used in racing cars.Being a coal surplus country, production of methanol will not be an issue, believes Gadkari.“Methanol is Rs 22 per litre and emits much less harmful gases and there are compan+ies which make methanol from coal. We are coal surplus country. We can have trucks and other engines powered by methanol”, added Gadkari.']"

However, it may not be the best approach. “Investors should never pick investment schemes only on the basis of past performance. One should focus on hypothesis of the funds and how relevant they are in current market environment,” says Roopali Prabhu, Head of Investment Products, Sanctum Wealth management.Here are five schemes that are being recommended by wealth managers but not necessarily rank at the top of the performance charts.Axis Focussed 25 Fund: Compared to other equity offerings of Axis Mutual Fund, this is a relatively new offering and runs a concentratedportfolio. The scheme is managed by Jinesh Gopani. “The scheme offers to pick the best of the investment ideas of the fund manager. Though the portfolio is concentrated it has large cap bias and actively managed.

This has ensured that the fund has done well in the long term,” explains Nishant Agarwal, Managing Partner & Head - Family Office, ASK Wealth Advisors. The stocks are not cheap anymore and inclusion of such a scheme can help your portfolio to weather volatile times.Invesco India Contra Fund: The diversified offering by Invesco Mutual Fund is a decade old one. The scheme is managed by Amit Ganatra since August 2012. Taher Badshah started co-managing the scheme since January 2017. Ashish Shanker, head – private wealth investment advisory, Motilal Oswal Wealth Management recommends the scheme saying, “The fund employs value style of investing with a contrarian approach. The fund manager focusses on bottom up approach and does not shy away from taking significant deviation from benchmark.”The bottom up stock selection has led to significant outperformance to the benchmark.

Cautioning against any sale of assets of JIL and JAL, and against merger or de-merger, the Bench had said, “We are only concerned with the deposit of money and any such move (sale or merger, etc) will amount to contempt of court... if anyone does that, then Tihar (jail) is not far from here.”It directed JAL, holding firm of Jaypee Infratech (JIL), to provide details of its housing projects in the country, saying homebuyers should either get their houses or their money back.A Bench headed by CJI Dipak Misra, however, refused to accord urgent hearing on a plea of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) seeking its nod to initiate insolvency proceedings before the National Company Law Tribunal against JAL and said it would be dealt with at a later stage.“Lower middle-class homebuyers of JAL cannot be made to run from forum to forum. We want to protect homebuyers,” the Bench had said while refusing urgent hearing on the RBI’s plea.The Bench had asked Pawanshree Agrawal, appointed amicus curiae to assist it, to set up a second portal to take note of grievances of the homebuyers, and said the grievance portal be “kept alive”. Earlier, a similar portal was directed to be set up for the homebuyers of JILDuring the hearing, senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi and lawyer Anupam Lal Das, appearing for JAL, said only eight percent of homebuyers have opted for refund of money and 92 percent wanted delivery of their homes.The court also considered the submission of senior advocate Ranjit Kumar, representing eight independent directors of JAL, that they were old and resided in different parts of the country and should be exempted from personal appearance but reiterated its earlier direction that neither would they leave the country without its prior nod, nor would they alienate or create third-party interests in their personal properties.At the last hearing on November 22, the Supreme Court had allowed the parent company of Jaypee Infratech Ltd to deposit Rs 275 crore on that day and another Rs 275 crore by December 31 (Rs 150 crore by December 13, 2017 and Rs 125 crore by December 31, 2017).No specific timeline was given to deposit the remaining Rs 1,450 crore.

The only indulgence is to pay the same in instalments.”This was against the earlier order asking the promoters to deposit Rs 2000 crore by November 13 which the promoters were unable to meet even after four deadlines expired.In November, the SC registry wanted the amount of Rs 275 crore deposited by the troubled Jaypee Associates to be transferred from the general account of the SC to a fixed deposit so that it could earn interest. The request has been accepted.The amicus curiae of the Jaypee insolvency case, Pawan Shri Aggarwal, was directed by the Supreme Court last month to update the portal where homebuyers who have booked apartments in various Jaypee projects in Noida could register their claims.On September 11 this year, SC directed Jaypee Associates, the parent firm of its real estate firm Jaypee Infratech, to deposit Rs 2,000 crore by October 27.

These include those involved in construction, cement, building material products, housing finance, FMCG, consumer durables, amongst others.While it gets difficult to comment on the probability of LTCG being introduced, we believe it should be low, especially considering that this asset class is not very significant in size (relative to other financial assets).Not to mention that the government has been promoting investment in equities for long-term wealth building, especially towards individual and retail investors in recent times.What could, however, be an alternative to this could be the extension of the timeline that defines LTCG (one year and beyond currently), which may not be a bad idea as it could promote long-term investment into equities.Q) Expectations are high from the government about likely some package for the agricultural sectors to boost rural income. What are your expectations from the Budget from agri sector and what stocks are likely to benefit the most?A) With the likelihood of the budget being pro-poor, there could be incentives going in the way of the rural economy, including a focus on job creation. Not to mention that the expectations for tax cuts and lower rates for individuals and corporate both are high as well.All of these will have a trickledown effect on consumption and will give a fillip to areas such as farm mechanization, fertilizer usage, auto consumption and NBFCs.These areas would get a further boost if the government allocates higher amounts towards crop insurance (given its importance) and a special focus on rolling out direct benefit transfer (given that it has helped curb the leakage in the system considerably) quicker.Q) Valuations of small and midcap stocks are already trading at a hefty premium. Do you see the party continuing in this space and what is the kind of strategy which investors should adopt?A) From a broad perspective, valuations concerns do remain. However, a bottom-up approach is warranted, as it makes sense for one to look at businesses with long runways of growth, strong balance sheets and good quality of earnings.Stocks of companies having such traits will do well over longer periods as they would benefit from the power of compounding.Having said that, it would make sense for investors to exit stocks where the valuations are high and fundamentals are poor, as over the long term such a combination has rarely led to good investment results.Q) Brent has already touched $70/bbl. What could be the repercussion for the market as well as for the economy?A) We think the markets have already priced this in. As long as crude remains within this range, there should not be any material impact on the market.Q) What will be your advice to investors for the year 2018 after a blockbuster rally seen in the year 2017?A) While long-term trend for the markets continues to remain positive, valuations does look stretched at current levels especially in certain pockets. Therefore, it would be prudent to keep booking profits but to keep the principal invested in the markets.Q) What are your contrarian bets which hold potential to bounce back in the next 2-3 years?A) Within the beaten down sectors, or the underperforming sectors – i.e. IT and pharma – there are select names that one can look at. The domestic plays in the pharma space and the midcap IT plays (with focus on products) would be good areas to look at.Another sector where one could see a lot of traction in the coming years is power. That is an area where major reforms are expected in the coming years. Therefore select names in the power sector could also be considered from a long-term perspective.']"

Hardik Pandya’s brother scored 243 runs at an average of 34.71 in the last edition and also took two wickets. It is highly likely that Mumbai Indians will use the right to match option for him.Prithvi Shaw– Although Shaw was unsold in the previous auction, few will bet on a repeat of a similar result this weekend.

He is also an off-spinner and was picked up by Sunrisers Hyderabad for an astounding Rs 4.2 crore in 2016. Having played 41 matches, the Baroda man is an experienced customer in this tournament.Kamlesh Nagarkoti– This teenage tearaway has generated quite a buzz in the ongoing U-19 World Cup with his speed and as fast bowlers are always in high demand in the T20 format, it won’t be a surprise if franchises go all out for him in the auction. There’s a good chance that Rajasthan Royals will go for him in the auction as he will also give the team a local connect.Rajneesh Gurbani– The find of the Ranji season, Rajneesh was one of the main reasons behind Vidarbha's fairytale run. He finished the season as the second-highest wicket-taker with 39 wickets. A proven swing bowler in Indian conditions would appeal to many franchises and having tasted blood with Vidarbha, his winning mentality will also help him settle down quickly in the slam bang format.""]"

They were taught to be at home and make peace with the fact that the breadwinner will always be the man in her family. In all stages of her life, she is, by default, under control of first her father and brothers and then, her husband.But writers like Woolf had the gut to question the society \'norms\' - the norms which had already decided a girl\'s fate in her life. The norms, so to say, pointed that women will not be allowed to work and even in most cases, pursue education.In her non-fiction book,A Room\'s of One\'s Own,written in 1929,\xa0she writes, ""A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction."" The quote directly points to how a woman who is chained to the societal norms urges to break open and live independently.\xa0 The writer dared the society by saying that even though a woman was obliged to follow the norms, in her book, she writes, ""Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind.""related newsNews in Pics: Your daily dose of pictures from around the worldPadmaavat controversy LIVE: 18 arrested in Gurugram school bus attack caseSupreme Court to hear plea against 4 states, Karni Sena for violence over \'Padmaavat\'Her belief in the oppressive nature of the society on women, did not stop with just one book.

Woolf was known to give a human and personal touch in her writings, which is the main reason why she is being remembered today by Google.The writer, however, suffered from depression. At the age of 59, the writer is believed to have committed suicide by filling up stones in the pockets of her clothing and walked into the sea to drown herself.

The stock has been consolidating since September 2017 high of 156.This consolidation has come in the form of a contracting triangle pattern during which prices hovered in a range of 135-134 on the downside and 156-157 on the upside.The stock has recently registered a resolute break out of this pattern with strong volume signalling resumption of the up move and provides fresh entry opportunity.The time-wise correction seen in the fourth quarter of last year barely retraced 38.2% of the up move from May 2017 low of 104.10 to October 2017 high of 157.50.Such a shallow price correction and extended time correction following a period of sustained gains augers well for the stock from a medium-term perspectiveWe believe the consolidation phase that lasted over 15 weeks has come to maturity, in turn, giving a fresh entry opportunity.We expect the stock to move higher and test our target area of 182 in the medium term as it is the pattern implication of a Triangle consolidation (158-133) as projected above the breakout level of 157.NRB Bearings: BUY| CMP Rs169| Target Rs204| Stop Loss Rs153| Return 20%| Time Frame 3 monthsThe share price of NRB Bearings has recently registered a 24 months consolidation breakout from the broad range of 162 and 100 with the strong volume of almost three times the 12 months average volume of 30 lakhs share per month indicating larger participation in the direction of the trend.After a strong rally in December 2017, the stock entered a consolidation phase over the last four weeks during, which it formed a higher low after having retraced just 38.2% of the preceding rally | 141 to | 182 indicating robust price structure.Monthly MACD is in a strong uptrend and has recently generated a buy signal moving above its nine periods average thus supports the positive bias in the stock.We expect the stock to head higher in the near-term towards 205, being the price parity of the previous up move from 141 to 182 as projected from a recent trough of 164.Disclaimer: The author is Head Technical, AVP at ICICI Direct.com Research.

Asian Paints has given cautiously optimistic outlook on demand as economy post-GST implementation has started stabilising.The demand scenario looks encouraging as low penetration in small towns/rural India and GOI focus on affordable housing boosts demand for decorative paints in coming years.The near-term margin pressure looks likely as input costs linked to crude and Tio2 have firmed up. The domestic brokerage firm expects Asian Paints to outperform Kansai Nerolac (30% outperformance over APNT in 12 months) as it has just 5 percent contribution from Auto and Industrial paints (lower pricing power) than 40 percent for Kansai.Dr Reddy’s LaboratoriesLtd: Overweight| Target Rs3133| Return 22%Morgan Stanley maintains an overweight rating on Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories with a target price of Rs3133.

Hence, not every bank will do all types of lending. Large project lending requiring specialised underwriting skills is going to be a forte of the few large/specialised banks whereas majority of the surviving mid-sized PSBs will focus on lending to small & medium sized enterprises.Lending will be much more ring-fenced with rigorous due diligence. Loans above Rs 250 crore will be specially monitored with red flags if covenants are breached.related news100% FDI in single-brand retail: A much-needed booster shot?Can relaxed investment norms help Air India find buyers?ONGC HPCL deal – valuation premium for synergies or to plug the fiscal gap?In addition the focus areas are going to be facilitating lending to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises' (MSMEs) through the portal 'Udyami Mitra' launched by SIDBI, deepening financial inclusion and promoting digitisation.The great banking recapitalisationOut of the total Rs 2 lakh 11 thousand crore of recapitalisation, government has specified the first tranche of \xa0over Rs 1 lakh crore – Rs 8139 crore from gross budgetary support, Rs 10,312 crore from the market and the remaining Rs 88,000 crore through recapitalisation bonds.The recapitalisation bonds will be liquidity neutral. It will be swap transaction whereby PSBs will subscribe to these recapitalisation bonds (that are not going to be a part of their SLR securities) and government in turn will infuse equity capital to these entities.Capital for the ailingHowever, the capital is being given to the healthier group for growth and to the others for survival and to give them a “second chance”. In fact, 60% of the capital in the first tranche is going to go to the weaker entities (that are under Prompt & Corrective Action of RBI). The objective is to infuse regulatory capital, strengthen governance and operations. These entities would be subject to close monitoring and would be eligible for capital based on performance.This should give a decent boost to their capital adequacy. But weighed down by asset quality woes, their ability to participate in the credit market remains a remote possibility. However, the capital will help them comply with the provisioning requirements as bad asset resolution gathers steam.(CAR – capital adequacy ratio, GNPA – gross non-performing assets)In the past one year, majority of these banks have not participated in disbursing credit and we do not see an imminent recovery, thereby giving the well-capitalised competitors with strong liability an edge.However, the quantum of capital given to IDBI Bank and Bank of India shows government’s serious intention in reviving these entities and a possible move to privatise IDBI at a later stage cannot be ruled out.Capital for growthGovernment has also decided to infuse more capital to the healthy PSBs as they are likely to take up the baton of growth in the upturn of the credit cycle.Some of the entities like SBI, PNB and Union Bank have raised capital (by way of Qualified Institutional Placement) in recent times and should make good use of the additional support in bringing the requisite risk appetite back.In this group, however, the superior quality of liability will be the key differentiator in winning the market share game as the market has moved to MCLR (marginal cost of lending rate) based lending. In a rising rate regime, cost of funds will be a key differentiator.In addition to recapitalisation, these PSBs will actively pursue possibilities of exiting from non-core businesses and monetising real estates. The government has also reassured depositors that their money is safe and reiterated its commitment to tackle large bad loans through NCLT (national company law tribunal).So who gains the most?Unequivocally it is the Indian economy. Through recapitalisation, government has created additional credit off take capacity of more than Rs 5 lakh crore -\xa0\xa0 6% of outstanding bank credit and 60% of the incremental credit of the past one year.Credit growth has seen a turnaround (11% year on year growth from the lows of 5%). Not just for the demonetisation base, large section of bankers are guiding to a genuine revival. The recap will only bolster this momentum.The capital especially to the banks under PCA will help expedite the resolution process under NCLT as banks would be required to take significant provisioning in the coming few quarters.The momentum in credit growth and resolution of NPA spell good news for well capitalised private entities. In a market that will incrementally chase high quality credit, the strength of the liability franchise will differentiate the men from the boys.

Despite this fact, people still avoid it due to the complicated rules of investment like compulsory certain proportionate of investment into an annuity, taxation of at least 20% of the corpus at the time of withdrawal, etc. “What will make this a popular mode of investment is if these rules of investment are simplified and the tax implication gets reduced.

The scheme allowed State to keep surveillance over its citizens which is violative of the fundamental right to privacy, he said, adding that the pre-Act and post-Act scenario on this count remained unaltered.By enabling private agencies, the citizens\' right to ""informational privacy"" has been infringed, he said, adding it would lead to a situation where an individual cannot hold a bank account, mutual fund and mobile number and hence, would violate ""autonomy and dignity"" of an individual.In a digital society, every individual has the right to protect his or her personal information, he said, adding that it helped the State to profile its citizens.The scheme violates the principle of ""less governance"" and rather turn the State into a ""totalitarian"" one, he said.If government disables the Aadhaar account of an individual then it would lead to his civil death as he will not be able to have anything like mobile or open bank accounts, he said, adding if the biometric details of a citizen does not match with the already collected ones then a person would die in the eyes of the State.Divan then disputed the passage of Aadhaar Bill in the House, saying it was illegally termed as ""Money Bill"" and said it would be further argued by senior lawyers like Kapil Sibal at a later stage.The advancing of arguments remained inconclusive and would continue on January 30.The apex court had on December 15 last year extended till March 31 the deadline for mandatory linking of Aadhaar with various services and welfare schemes of all ministries and departments of the Centre, states and union territories.']"

The scheme allowed State to keep surveillance over its citizens which is violative of the fundamental right to privacy, he said, adding that the pre-Act and post-Act scenario on this count remained unaltered.By enabling private agencies, the citizens\' right to ""informational privacy"" has been infringed, he said, adding it would lead to a situation where an individual cannot hold a bank account, mutual fund and mobile number and hence, would violate ""autonomy and dignity"" of an individual.In a digital society, every individual has the right to protect his or her personal information, he said, adding that it helped the State to profile its citizens.The scheme violates the principle of ""less governance"" and rather turn the State into a ""totalitarian"" one, he said.If government disables the Aadhaar account of an individual then it would lead to his civil death as he will not be able to have anything like mobile or open bank accounts, he said, adding if the biometric details of a citizen does not match with the already collected ones then a person would die in the eyes of the State.Divan then disputed the passage of Aadhaar Bill in the House, saying it was illegally termed as ""Money Bill"" and said it would be further argued by senior lawyers like Kapil Sibal at a later stage.The advancing of arguments remained inconclusive and would continue on January 30.The apex court had on December 15 last year extended till March 31 the deadline for mandatory linking of Aadhaar with various services and welfare schemes of all ministries and departments of the Centre, states and union territories.']"

To set up even one school, I would need a nod from the Delhi Development Authority, a body with a misleading nomenclature, for it came under the jurisdiction of the Union Ministry of Urban Development, not the Delhi State.If I wanted to pursue power sector reforms, the approval of the Union power ministry would be essential. To create any new infrastructure for the people of central Delhi, I would have to engage with the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), which remained outside the Delhi government’s control even though it was represented by an MLA in the Delhi Assembly. In this instance, I was the MLA from there.Apart from the NDMC, there was the Municipal Corporation, which covered the civic needs of the rest of Delhi. Although people expected me to make their lives more secure, I had no control over Delhi Police, which reported to the Union Home Ministry. Any desire to augment Delhi’s water supply would necessitate turning to neighbouring states for help. Moreover, almost every file had to go to the Lieutenant Governor for approval. This cumbersome process of requiring so many levels of approval was unique to Delhi. But the bottom line was that full statehood or not, to the people of Delhi, the Chief Minister, signified the face of governance. They would not have much patience for a chief minister trying to explain an underwhelming ‘report card’ by enumerating all the areas that fell outside her jurisdiction.related newsNews in Pics: Your daily dose of pictures from around the worldPadmaavat controversy LIVE: 18 arrested in Gurugram school bus attack caseSupreme Court to hear plea against 4 states, Karni Sena for violence over 'Padmaavat'There are two ways of dealing with such situations. One can throw up one’s hands and say it is impossible to perform under these circumstances or negotiate one’s way through innumerable minefields in the belief that the primary aim is to deliver on the promise of governance.I preferred the second approach. It was more in line with my temperament and inclination. Besides, who all could I take up cudgels against? Why, even the weather of Delhi is not its own! When it snows in Shimla or Srinagar, we shiver in Delhi. When farmers in Punjab and Haryana burn crop residues in their fields, we choke on the toxic smog it creates.These were the thoughts going on in my mind as I, along with my cabinet, went to the Raj Bhavan to take the oath of office. I had been given a free hand to choose the team I wanted and I opted for seasoned individuals who knew the lay of the land. Among them were Narendra Nath, Yoganand Shastri, Dr A.K. Walia, former mayor, Mahinder Singh Saathi, Pervez Hashmi and Krishna Tirath. The fact that the size of the Cabinet could not comprise more than seven ministers or ten per cent of the total House strength did not provide much room for manoeuvering.After the swearing in, the new cabinet went to the Delhi Secretariat, that is, the Old Secretariat, for a meeting with the Chief Secretary. I felt a sense of thrill as I walked into the beautiful heritage building. Considered by many to be the first modern building of Delhi, it was constructed a year after Delhi was declared the capital of British India in 1911. The building also functioned as the central legislature until 1927, when the Parliament building was completed. I was told that the previous government had been sanctioned an alternative for a new secretariat some time ago, in light of the fact that the gracious building was somewhat cramped. But they had dragged their feet on it. After a lunch meeting with the Chief Secretary, I briefly shared my views with my colleagues, emphasising that it was critical to address the obvious problems areas that affected the daily lives of Delhiites.Feeling disheartened with the labyrinthine process of getting approvals for policies and proposals was not an option. We needed to hit the ground running and keep communication lines open with our constituents. If everybody felt the need to have party meetings more frequently, then we could meet once a week or every ten days. I also reminded them that here on we represented the people of Delhi and not the party alone. For that reason we should not ignore the requests of opposition party MLAs. I relinquished my position as DPCC chief immediately so that I could focus on governance and communicated the same to Mrs Gandhi. After what seemed an unusually long day, I returned home.The day had been full of celebratory flavours, starting with euphoric Congress workers dancing to the beat of the dholak and the peekni outside the Raj Bhavan. But the sheer exhaustion of seven months of relentless campaigning had finally caught up with me. I put on some music to unwind. Only then did I admit to myself that I had missed Vinod and Dadda’s presence every moment of the day.""]"

But only 74 of these startups have been approved for availing tax benefits, as of January, 2018.']","[""Durba GhoshThe central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is mighty focussed on supporting startups to drive the economy further.The Startup India program launched in January 2016 was a step towards creating a conducive ecosystem for emerging businesses in India. But the program, envisaged to provide financial and mentoring support to startups, has not seen much impact on the ground even a year after its launch.For the year 2018, the government has set ambitious targets regarding funding VC and angel funds that are investing in startups.related newsBudget 2018: Will it provide benefit for retirement products like PPF and NPS?India has made some big changes lately - a top entrepreneur says it's paying offDavos 2018: PM has hinted that Budget might not be populist, says Rahul BajajThe Funds of Funds (FFS) managed by Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), is expected to be topped up with existing allocation inBudget 2018to over Rs 2000 crore. So far, the fund has received just about Rs 800 crore of the Rs 10,000 crore committed.The corpus is designed to be released over two Finance Commission cycles, by 2025.FFS invests in SEBI registered Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs) which, in turn, invest in Startups.A total of Rs 605.7 crore has been allocated to 17 AIFs till now and about 75 Startups have received funding from these AIFs, such as Kae Capital Fund II, Orios Venture Partners Funds II, Pi Ventures Fund I among others.Problems in getting certified as a startupHowever, as the program stands at present, ventures wanting to avail the benefits have a hard time even to be recognized as a startup.“Innovation is definitely a key factor to choose startups, but what defines it? The purview needs to be expanded so that more entrepreneurs can benefit from it. The SIDBI fund allocation is also very ambiguous. The government must throw some clarity on the corpus,” Manish Singhal, founding partner of Pi Ventures said.Acknowledging the long gestation period for startups, the program has now amended the definition to consider a venture as a 'Startup' for up to 7 years. The criterion was 5 years earlier.Biotechnology setups will be considered a startup for up to 10 years from the date of its incorporation.Also, the scope of definition has been broadened to include a scalable business model with high potential for employment generation or wealth creation.Additionally, no letter of recommendation from an incubator/industry association shall be required for either recognition or tax benefits.According to the Startup India Policy website, DIPP has till now recognised 6,096 companies in India as startups. But only 74 of these startups have been approved for availing tax benefits, as of January 2018.Some funds such as Chiratae Trust, which was sanctioned the highest corpus of Rs 90 crore under FFS, funded 10 startups till September.Several others including Omnivore Partners India Fund II, Aavishkar Bharat Fund, Stakeboat Capital Fund, IndiaQuotient II, and Kitven Fund III have funded a limited number of companies with the government money.Kae Capital Fund II with Rs 45 crore sanctions has funded the highest number of startups till now at 20.The even more pressing issue for the startups in India is taxation.Several startups have faced “unfair” scrutiny from Income Tax department since last year regarding valuations at which they raised capital from angel investors.The Income Tax Act of 2012 states that any consideration that a company receives from a resident in excess of a fair value, then such shares will be taxed as 'income from other sources', also known as Angel Tax.The angel tax issueAt present, the angel tax rate stands at a whopping 30 percent, which according to Nasscom has resulted in a 53 percent drop in angel funding during the first half of 2017.“We have spoken about this issue. The methods of assessment in India are flawed, which creates a mismatch between how investors assess a startup and how tax authorities do the same. It is very arbitrary,” says prominent angel investor Mohandas Pai, who has invested in over 40 startups startups such as Zoomcar, Tripoto, Tracxn, GoCoop, LetsVenture, HomeLane, Zimmber and others.In the quarter ending June, venture capital investments in startups in India declined by over 25 percent from a year ago. The amount slid to USD 275 million in 78 deals from last year’s USD 309 million in 104 investments, according to a report by research firm Venture Intelligence.The startup stakeholders are also urging the government to expand the coverage of Mudraa and other credit guarantee schemes to cover startups.The government has also kept Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) out of the purview of tax holiday for startups, which essentially taxes daily cash flow and not profits generated through daily operations.Under MAT, all companies that have booked profits under Companies Act are required to pay taxes at the rate of 18.5 percent. The industry is asking for an exemption on MAT or at least a reduction in the rate, to balance out benefits of other tax reforms for startups.durba.ghosh@nw18.comIndia Union Budget 2018: What does Finance Minister Arun Jaitley have up his sleeve?Click here for top and latest Budget 2018 news, views and analyses.""]"

ICRA\'s sample set of companies\' operating margins fell from around 26-27 percent till Q3FY2017 to their current 18-19 percent, despite various cost control initiatives undertaken by companies.“While ICRA expects the pricing pressure to sustain over the next 12 months, significant reduction in prices will render the US generic business unattractive for many players enabling stabilisation and positive price changes in the medium term,"" Jain said.Further, Indian companies that have a pipeline of complex generics will benefit from a faster approval cycle and higher margins before other complex generics entry intensify pricing pressure.']"

At our level, we work very strongly through multilateral framework which is the only way forward.""We urge other nations to take steps and we hope this diligence with which we work towards a safer world will yield result,"" he said.Akbar asserted that we need to question why no steps are being taken against proliferation.The panel discussed the increasing number of nuclear states and threat of ""first use"" of nuclear weapons as dual global risks on the rise.The panel members discussed what political, diplomatic and military options can mitigate or manage such existential threats.They also sought to understand why nuclear threats are back on the table.Other areas of discussion included re-evaluating the risk/reward balance in nuclear deterrence and how to keep the human factor in focus.']"

What’s driving your investment strategy?,"['Business', 'markets']",['There are ways to tell if fear of missing out is influencing your investment strategy. '],"['Manoj NagpalSpeaking to investors, one can sense there is a growing feeling of FoMO setting in. To put a case in point, yesterday the CEO of a multinational bank, visibly agitated, called me and said, ""My wealth manager has misguided me. Last year, he told me to be cautious and only buy the dips. I just couldn\'t buy the market last year. This has resulted that I have over USD 1 million lying in liquid funds. I want to go all in now and not be a fool anymore. What\'s your view?""Fear of missing out\xa0or\xa0FoMO\xa0is ""a pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent"".\xa0 The question that every investor needs ask is whether this FoMO is driving their fresh investments or is it the underlying fundamentals? Let\'s try to identify the signals that you can watch out for which tell you whether you are falling prey to FoMO or are you still following fundamentals.Signal 1: ""Savings are ultimately for long term and should be all in equities""related newsLIC MF starts \'daily SIP\' for 7 schemes; aims 30% growthBilateral APAs – India’s preferred method of dispute resolution100% ethanol-run bikes to be launched this month: Nitin GadkariThe minute you stop appreciating the role of asset-allocation in your portfolio and believe that all savings should be equities is the first sign to watch out for. Every asset class has a role to play in your portfolio due to the cyclical nature of returns of equities. Portfolio structure has to be built on the ground rule that reduces volatility and optimises returns by the cushioning effect of other asset classes when equities undergo a cyclical downturn.\xa0 Don\'t get me wrong, I am not saying that we are on a cusp of an equity market bust. But that a downturn will come and will come at a time when you least expect is a certainty and even if all your savings is for the long-term your portfolio volatility can eat the incremental returns. Always build the safety net in good times.Signal 2: Memories of 2016/2017 are about missing the rally rather than your familyWhen Rajesh\'s 12-year-old son asked him, ""Do you remember June 2016?"", Rajesh immediately said ""Yes, missed buying the Brexit dip!!""\xa0 This is a true incident that happened to Rajesh. As soon as he said it, he realised his son was talking about their vacation and regretted just thinking about the markets. Rajesh realised that his most clear memories of the last two years have been the equity market dips that he did not buy into. If this starts happening to you, you are in the ""FoMO Trap"". This also transcends into additional signals such as your trading style changes to putting buy orders at market, getting anxious if you will get the same day\'s NAV or not when you buy mutual funds among others. This will lead to your anxiety levels going up not your portfolio value.Signal 3: Your architect brother-in-law tells you which stock to buy and you actually buy itThe classic signal is that someone close to you – either friend or family member or even your lift-man – who didn\'t know about equity markets till some time back now professes to having inside information. The bigger worry begins when you actually start believing this and start buying stocks based on any such random information that is floating in your environment. Ah, I know you will say that you will never do this. But believe me this is a reality of every bull markets and a signal that is one of the most powerful ones to watch out for.Signal 4: This Time it is different!This is the most repeated signal of every bull market. All market participants start believing in this they are living in a momentous bull market and the bull market will never end or well at least will continue for a long time.\xa0 This bull markets ""this time it is different"" story is the huge inflows coming into equity markets through SIPs into mutual funds, growing inflows of pension funds (EPFO), increasing share of insurance companies in equities even in their traditional plan etc. With almost USD 1 billion of SIP inflows every month, there are equity traders now who take their long positions before the 1st and 10th of every month as most of the SIP inflows happen around these two popular dates.\xa0 This kind of strategies are bound to work till they finally fail and if you are into this category, you should step back and think.Investing for the long term and investing because you have missed out the last year\'s rally are two different things. If FoMO is getting to you, you need to arrest and overcome this emotion and go back to the fundamentals of buying stocks, mutual funds etc only if they fit in your financial goals and that too after a detailed study of the fundamentals. That\'s the only way to create lasting wealth.']"

At the same time tax and regulatory changes along with untapped potential of economy has facilitated significant flow of capital from private equity and venture capital industry (PE and VC).It is important to note that the fledging startup eco system in India would not have survived had VC and angel funding would not have backed their innovative and part breaking ideas. Government has equally recognised the contribution of PE and VC industry and accordingly has crated enablers in tax and regulatory regime so it can attract large number of investors. However, there are few niggles in the tax regime which can be fixed inBudget 2018.Pass-through tax status to be extended to net losses at Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) level to the Investorrelated newsBudget 2018: Will it provide benefit for retirement products like PPF and NPS?Davos 2018: PM has hinted that Budget might not be populist, says Rahul BajajGovt aims to bridge education divide, expect more JNVs in Budget: Prakash JavadekarThe intention of pass through status was to ensure that there should not be any difference in tax treatment for Investor investing through an AIF or directly in a portfolio company. Currently, Income Tax Act, 1961, (the Act) provides that if losses are incurred by AIF same shall be carried forward by AIF and shall be set off against the income of AIF.Allowing AIF to set off the losses against income of AIF is not feasible proposition as it does not earn the income in its own account.In order to make AIF pass through entirely and bring it at par with direct investment by Investors, losses incurred by AIF should be allowed to be set off against the capital gains of the Investors.Allow management expenses for AIF investments to be capitalized as ‘cost of improvement’The investment manager of AIFs play active role in supporting the portfolio companies to take them to particular economies of scale, building professional management etc. The management fees are mainly paid to manage the investment in the portfolio companies which in turn results in enhancing the value of investment made by AIF. Therefore, management fees is akin to cost incurred to improve the value of investment. Therefore, law can be amended to provide mechanism to allow allocation of these expenses as cost of improvement against investments.Tax on primary investment in companies:Currently excess of premium received by the companies against valuation of the companies which are prepared on the basis of financial performance of the companies is taxed in the hands of recipient companies. One needs to note that startups are funded on the basis of innovative ideas and economic potential.. In the initial years most startups end up incurring\xa0losses and therefore valuing them purely on financial performance could be misleading. Therefore in order to reduce protracted litigations, provision needs to be rationalized.Valuation of unquoted equity sharesAs per the current laws, in case of a commercially negotiated transaction involving transfer of unquoted shares, both acquirer and the transferor may suffer tax burden in case the value at which the transaction is being concluded is not in confirmation with the valuation rules which have been prescribed by the regulators. These provisions are intended to be an anti-abuse measure to cover under its ambit the transfer of unlisted shares at prices below their Fair Market Value. There are difficulties faced in case of genuine transfers of unquoted shares having a commercial rationale such as distress sale. A suitable carve out need to be provided for such transactions so it is neither taxed in the hands of seller nor in the hands of buyers.Indirect transfersThe purpose of introducing the indirect transfer provisions was to ensure that transaction which are happening outside India but derive their values from India should be taxed in India. However, the present law contains certain gaps which has unintended consequences. In the fund industry, typically multi-layer structure is followed for various commercial and legal reasons. Therefore, testing indirect transfer at each level of remittance would lead to cascading of tax. Further currently carve out is restricted to internal reorganization which happens through mergers/demergers which is not only the mode of reorganisation. The Finance Minister during the last budget indicated that for investment made through FDI route, after its remittance from India, same should not be taxed on subsequent remittance, however appropriate amendment in legislation has not been carried out.The aforesaid amendments could go a long way in fostering the PE and VC industry and facilitate the larger flow of long term strategic capital to the country supporting the enormous need to capital formation in the country.(Alok Mundra is KPMG Tax Partner)(Shital Gharge – Director at KPMG contributed to the article)India Union Budget 2018: What does Finance Minister Arun Jaitley have up his sleeve?Click here for top and latest Budget 2018 news, views and analyses.']"

Here, we will deal with some of the problematic areas.For consumers, it may just seem like new tax slabs of 0%, 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%, but for businesses GST has brought in 13 types of return filing forms - GSTR-1, GSTR 2, GSTR 3, GSTR 3B, GSTR 4, GSTR 5, GSTR 6, GSTR 7, GSTR 8, GSTR 9, GSTR 9A, GSTR 10, and GSTR-11.related newsBudget 2018: Will it provide benefit for retirement products like PPF and NPS?India has made some big changes lately - a top entrepreneur says it's paying offDavos 2018: PM has hinted that Budget might not be populist, says Rahul BajajHowever, one is not required to file all the forms, but file forms relevant to one’s nature of the business.What is cumbersome for companies having a turnover of more than Rs 1.5 crore is the filing of 3 forms every month, besides an annual returns form. That makes it a total of 37 forms in a year - a lot of pressure on time and resources of businesses, particularly mid-small scale.SME companies struggling to file GSTIt has been\xa0six months since GST was rolled out, and most companies have not been able to file their returns in time.Since most companies were lagging behind the schedule, the government has waived off the late fee of INR 50 per day for the month of July, August, and September - definitely some consideration from the government, but not good enough to tackle the basic problem.The problem is that businesses have to match each and every invoice that is generated by them or their suppliers every month, and that puts a lot of pressure on the medium and small businesses.The big companies do not suffer much as they have resources to handle such pressures.The problem, several business owners have complained, is compounded because the GST portal, which has not been able to cope with the sudden pressure, hangs very often, leading to anxiety among small company owners as they are liable to be charged Rs 200 per day for the delay.Cos hiring people just to handle GST complianceWell, besides the time constraints, the companies also have to depute additional resources to tackle the increased workload, and that has financial implications.This is because each and every invoice has to be uploaded on the GST portal and it must match with the returns filed by vendors. Moreover, rigorous follow-ups are required to close the data.The problem becomes all the more difficult for e-commerce companies where tax is deducted at source as they supply the products and need to fill a special GSTR-8 form which is mandatory.The task becomes gigantic for startups as they have a limited budget and cannot afford to have staff which is fully deputed to do the GST work.According to a report by the Internet and Mobile Association of India, India’s e-commerce market is estimated to have crossed Rs. 211,005 crore in December 2016, and it is expected to generate $100 billion online retail revenue by the year 2020.The government needs to see that this growth is not affected by policies such as GST.Does GST promote ease of doing business?There is no doubt that a unified tax system is a great step forward towards standardizing the tax collection across the nation.But the need to match tax credits on each invoice makes things rather tedious and it, in a way, defeats the aim of achieving ease of doing business.From the above, it is clear that businesses have been put to great strain due to GST procedures, but both the central and state governments seem to be alive to the situation and are trying to find a solution.In my view, what will definitely help is the quarterly filing of returns, instead of monthly, as this will give a breathing space to companies to depute their resources more judiciously and comply with the GST norms.(The author is Co-founder and Head of Finance at policybazaar.com.

,moneycontrol,Features,[''],[],Will Indian real estate be ready to run in 2018?,"['Features', 'Real Estate']",[],"[""For the discerning investor, the start of a new year offers a chance for reflection and planning, for mulling over what happened and what to do next - and few sectors have as much to contemplate as real estate.When the story of the great Indian economic boom is written, 2017 will be remembered as a pivotal year, one where the country undertook, in earnest, the long-awaited transformation into a modern, integrated economy. While India went through a moderate slowdown in 2017, this was more due to the growing pains of an economy coming to terms with essential reforms than any underlying economic issues.This dynamic played out within property markets as well, with essential reforms causing a temporary drop in growth in 2017.As investors look forward, 2018 promises some green shoots of recovery in Indian real estate, where the reliability offered by new regulations aligns with the returns of past years.related newsEx-JLL India Capital Markets MD launches ANB Capital AdvisorsIt's time we budget for home buyers’ concernsReform was on the menu for every sector of the Indian economy in 2017, from the passage of the all-encompassing GST to more sector-specific legislation like the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) Act. These regulations undeniably caused a short-term dip in growth, as businesses were faced to confront untenable balance sheets and unsustainable business models. Economy-wide statistics reflect this, with estimates placing annual GDP growth around 6.5%, down from 2016’s rate of 7.1%. However, the coming year promises to be one of growth and wealth creation, with Morgan Stanleyprojecting a growth rate of 7.5%in 2018, cementing India’s status as the fastest growing economy in the world.Real estate was no exception to this dynamic, with the aforementioned RERA Act creating a liquidity crunch among developers who’d previously used funds raised for one project to finance another (a practice that often left investors in the first venture facing a cash-depleted and delayed project for years on end). GST, as well, was initially greeted with scepticism, as developers waited to see how the new tax would be levied and enforced. Add thelingering effects of demonetizationinto the picture, and the slow sales numbers of 2017 cease to be a surprise.However, a cursory examination of long-term trends suggests that such a slowdown could be seen as growing pains for the industry. Foreign direct investment in Indian real estate saw a 70% increase over the previous three years, buoyed by major structural reforms in FDI norms, as well as comprehensive industry reform. The commercial and retail sectors, especially, attracted investments, with PE giant Blackstone increasing its portfolio in the country to 100 million square feet - a number that made the firm the world’s largest office landlord.As international capital flows into the country, India’s real estate ecosystem is undergoing a transformation of its own, with the developer industry heading towards substantial consolidation and professionalization. As smaller, less scrupulous developers find their balance sheets increasingly trending towards the red, they will flock toward both the Grade-A players and institutional capital. In both cases, the quality of projects will increase and the pressure to avoid delays will mount, as institutional investors will require timely returns and household names like Sobha and Prestige will not want a stalled development to tarnish their brand.They have plenty of reasons to keep their names in good standing; 300 million, to be precise. That’s the projected number of new urban residents India will add by 2050, as increasing urbanization and red-hot economic growth ensure a steady demand for decades to come. This growth will be marked by transparency and professionalism, as the regulations passed in 2017 are expected to streamline the entire industry. The RERA Act, for example, ensures developer transparency and provides homebuyers a suite of safeguards, while GST’s input tax credits and creation of a national market dramatically simplify real estate’s lengthy and previously inefficient supply chain.In many regards, the real estate sector is gradually emerging as a better-regulated, professionalized industry providing homes for the equivalent of the entire United States.When is the right time to invest, exactly? An investment in a premium residential development today is a safer investment than a few years ago, but the market has not yet fully priced in this decrease in risk. This is good news for investors, as returns will likely remain at pre-regulation levels in the short term, but investments made today are less risky than those of yesteryear.“The first few quarters of 2018 will offer an unparalleled opportunity to earn high-yield returns without risk of prolonged delays and unaccountable developers,” says Vikram Chari, CEO of SmartOwner,India’s largest property marketplace.This dynamic is playing out across the industry, as both the government and major sources of capital are requiring developers to deliver high-quality projects on time. As the rough seas of 2017 recede into the past, investors in Indian real estate can look forward to2018.""]"
